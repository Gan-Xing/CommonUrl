    "Hi! üëã Welcome to the Block Editor Handbook.",
    "The Block editor is a modern and up-to-date paradigm for WordPress site building and publishing. It uses a modular system of Blocks to compose and format content, and is designed to create rich and flexible layouts for websites and digital products.",
    "The editor consists of several primary elements, as shown in the following figure:",
    "",
    "The elements highlighted in the figure are:",
    "Through the Block editor, you create content modularly using Blocks. There are a number of core blocks ready to be used, and you can also create your own custom block.",
    "A Block is a discrete element such as a Paragraph, Heading, Media element, or Embed. Each block is treated as a separate element with individual editing and format controls. When all these components are pieced together, they make up the content that is then stored in the WordPress database.",
    "The Block Editor is the result of the work done on the Gutenberg project which is aimed to revolutionize the WordPress editing experience.",
    "Besides offering an enhanced editing experience through visual content creation tools, the Block Editor is also a powerful developer platform with a rich feature set of APIs that allow it to be manipulated and extended in a multitude of different ways.",
    "This handbook is focused on block development and is divided into five sections, each serving a different purpose.",
    "Getting Started",
    "For those just starting out with block development this is where you can get set up with a development environment and learn the fundamentals of block development.",
    "How-to Guides",
    "Here you can build on what you learned in the Getting Started section and learn how to solve particular problems that you might encounter. You can also get tutorials, and example code that you can reuse, for projects such as building a full-featured block or working with WordPress‚Äô data. In addition you can learn How to use JavaScript with the Block Editor.",
    "Reference Guides",
    "This section is the heart of the handbook and is where you can get down to the nitty-gritty and look up the details of the particular API that you‚Äôre working with or need information on. Among other things, the Block API Reference covers most of what you will want to do with a block, and each component and package is also documented here. Components are also documented via Storybook.",
    "Explanations",
    "This section enables you to go deeper and reinforce your practical knowledge with a theoretical understanding of the Architecture of the block editor. Its Glossary of terms and FAQs should answer any outstanding questions you may have.",
    "Contributor Guide",
    "Gutenberg is open source software and anyone is welcome to contribute to the project. This section details how to contribute and can help you choose in which way you want to contribute, whether that be with code, with design, with documentation, or in some other way.",
    "Top ‚Üë",
    "This handbook should be considered the canonical resource for all things related to block development. However there are other resources that can help you.",
    "This handbook is targeted at those seeking to develop for the block editor, but several other handbooks exist for WordPress developers under developer.wordpress.org:",
    "Notifications",
    "Welcome! Let‚Äôs get started building with blocks. Blocks are at the core of extending WordPress. You can create custom blocks, your own block patterns, or combine them together to build a block theme. At a high level, here are a few ways to begin your journey but read on to explore more:",
    "Development Environment ‚Äì A guide to setup your local environment for JavaScript development for creating plugins, themes, and the tools you will need to extend WordPress or contribute to the block editor.",
    "Create a Block Tutorial ‚Äì Learn how to create your first block for the WordPress block editor.",
    "Full Site Editing ‚Äì Full Site Editing (FSE) is an umbrella project name for the collection of features that bring the experience and extendability of blocks to all parts of your site‚Äîfrom settings and styles, to templates and themes, and more.",
    "Create a Block Theme ‚Äì Learn how block themes use blocks to build templates and the theme.json to provide styles.",
    "New features and changes are important to keep up to date on as the Gutenberg project continues. Each person will have their own unique needs in keeping up with a project of this scale. What follows is more of a catalogue of ways to keep up rather than a recommendation for how to do so.",
    "Yearly:",
    "The WordPress.org Roadmap with Four Phases of Gutenberg updated by project leadership. This is the highest level overview of the changes coming to WordPress.",
    "Quarterly:",
    "Quarterly Updates from Contribution Teams. These updates give an overview on what each team is working on, struggling with, and how to get involved.",
    "Monthly:",
    "‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Next In Gutenberg?‚Äù posts. These updates are wrangled by the Core Editor team and highlight areas of work aligned with the Gutenberg roadmap for contributors to help, how to get involved, and more.",
    "Block Based Themes Meeting. These meetings are currently wrangled in the #themereview Slack channel and are dedicated to sharing FSE changes that will specifically impact themes. Agendas and summaries are shared on the Make Themes blog.",
    "Biweekly:",
    "‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New In Gutenberg?‚Äù release posts. These updates are wrangled by the Core Editor team and focus on what‚Äôs been released in each biweekly Gutenberg release. They include the most relevant features released and a full changelog.",
    "Weekly:",
    "Core Editor meetings. These meetings are wrangled by volunteer members in the #core-editor Slack channel. Agendas and summaries are shared on the Make Core blog. They focus on task coordination and relevant discussions around Gutenberg releases. There is an Open Floor period in each chat where people can suggest topics to discuss.",
    "Weekly Theme Related Gutenberg Updates. These posts are focused on themes, including everything from current discussions to recent changes, as well as helpful resources for theme authors.",
    "Daily:",
    "Checking in on issues and PRs on GitHub. This will give you a nearly real-time understanding of what‚Äôs being worked on by the developers and designers.",
    "Slot and Fill are components that have been exposed to allow developers to inject items into some predefined places in the Gutenberg admin experience.\nPlease see the SlotFill component docs for more details.",
    "In order to use them, we must leverage the @wordpress/plugins api to register a plugin that will inject our items.",
    "In order to access the SlotFills, we need to do four things:",
    "Here is an example using the PluginPostStatusInfo slotFill:",
    "SlotFills are created using createSlotFill. This creates two components, Slot and Fill which are then used to create a new component that is exported on the wp.plugins global.",
    "Definition of the PluginPostStatusInfo SlotFill (see core code)",
    "This new Slot is then exposed in the editor. The example below is from core and represents the Summary panel.",
    "As we can see, the <PluginPostStatusInfo.Slot> is wrapping all of the items that will appear in the panel.\nAny items that have been added via the SlotFill ( see the example above ), will be included in the fills parameter and be displayed between the <PostAuthor/> and <PostTrash/> components.",
    "See core code.",
    "The following SlotFills are available in the edit-post package. Please refer to the individual items below for usage and example details:",
    "WordPress 6.1 has introduced some server-side filters to hook into the theme.json data provided at the different data layers:",
    "Each filter receives an instance of the WP_Theme_JSON_Data class with the data for the respective layer. To provide new data, the filter callback needs to use the update_with( $new_data ) method, where $new_data is a valid theme.json-like structure. As with any theme.json, the new data needs to declare which version of the theme.json is using, so it can correctly be migrated to the runtime one, should it be different.",
    "Example:",
    "This is how to pass a new color palette for the theme and disable the text color UI:",
    "The editor.Autocomplete.completers filter is for extending and overriding the list of autocompleters used by blocks.",
    "The Autocomplete component found in @wordpress/block-editor applies this filter. The @wordpress/components package provides the foundational Autocomplete component that does not apply such a filter, but blocks should generally use the component provided by @wordpress/block-editor.",
    "Here is an example of using the editor.Autocomplete.completers filter to add an acronym completer. You can find full documentation for the autocompleter interface with the Autocomplete component in the @wordpress/components package.",
    "When the editor is interacting with blocks, these are stored in memory as data structures comprising a few basic properties and attributes. Upon saving a working post we serialize these data structures into a specific HTML structure and save the resultant string into the post_content property of the post in the WordPress database. When we load that post back into the editor we have to make the reverse transformation to build those data structures from the serialized format in HTML.",
    "The process of loading the serialized HTML into the editor is performed by the block parser. The formal specification for this transformation is encoded in the parsing expression grammar (PEG) inside the @wordpress/block-serialization-spec-parser package. The editor provides a default parser implementation of this grammar but there may be various reasons for replacing that implementation with a custom implementation. We can inject our own custom parser implementation through the appropriate filter.",
    "Plugins have access to the parser if they want to process posts in their structured form instead of a plain HTML-as-string representation.",
    "The editor uses the client-side parser while interactively working in a post. The plain HTML-as-string representation is sent to the browser by the backend and then the editor performs the first parse to initialize itself.",
    "To replace the server-side parser, use the block_parser_class filter. The filter transforms the string class name of a parser class. This class is expected to expose a parse method.",
    "Note: At the present time it‚Äôs not possible to replace the client-side parser.",
    "The i18n functions (__(), _x(), _n() and _nx()) provide translations of strings for use in your code. The values returned by these functions are filterable if you need to override them, using the following filters:",
    "The filters are passed the following arguments, in line with their PHP equivalents.",
    "Here is a simple example, using the i18n.gettext filter to override a specific translation.",
    "Filters that are specific to the text domain you‚Äôre operating on are generally preferred for performance reasons (since your callback will only be run for strings in the relevant text domain).",
    "To attach to a text domain-specific filter append an underscore and the text-domain to the standard filter name. For example, if filtering a string where the text domain is ‚Äúwoocommerce‚Äù, you would use one of the following filters:",
    "For example:",
    "Note: To apply a filter where the text-domain is undefined (for example WordPress core strings), then use the name ‚Äúdefault‚Äù to construct the filter name.",
    "To modify the behavior of the editor experience, WordPress exposes several APIs.",
    "The following filters are available to extend the editor features.",
    "Used to modify the image size displayed in the Post Featured Image component. It defaults to 'post-thumbnail', and will fail back to the full image size when the specified image size doesn‚Äôt exist in the media object. It‚Äôs modeled after the admin_post_thumbnail_size filter in the classic editor.",
    "Filters the interstitial message shown when generating previews.",
    "Used to set or modify the crossOrigin attribute for foreign-origin media elements (i.e <audio> , <img> , <link> , <script>, <video>). See this article for more information the crossOrigin attribute, its values and how it applies to each element.",
    "One example of it in action is in the Image block‚Äôs transform feature to allow cross-origin images to be used in a <canvas>.",
    "Note: Before WordPress 5.8 known as block_editor_settings. In the case when you want to support older versions of WordPress you might need a way to detect which filter should be used ‚Äì the deprecated one vs the new one. The recommended way to proceed is to check if the WP_Block_Editor_Context class exists.",
    "This is a PHP filter which is applied before sending settings to the WordPress block editor.",
    "You may find details about this filter on its WordPress Code Reference page.",
    "The filter will send any setting to the initialized Editor, which means any editor setting that is used to configure the editor at initialiation can be filtered by a PHP WordPress plugin before being sent.",
    "Filters the array of REST API paths that will be used to preloaded common data to use with the block editor.",
    "If it is true the user can edit the content using the visual editor.",
    "It is set by default to the return value of the user_can_richedit function. It checks if the user can access the visual editor and whether it‚Äôs supported by the user‚Äôs browser.",
    "Default true. Indicates whether the user can access the code editor in addition to the visual editor.",
    "If set to false the user will not be able to switch between visual and code editor. The option in the settings menu will not be available and the keyboard shortcut for switching editor types will not fire.",
    "Note: Since WordPress 6.1.",
    "A JavaScript error in a part of the UI shouldn‚Äôt break the whole app. To solve this problem for users, React library uses a concept of an ‚Äúerror boundary‚Äù. Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.",
    "Allows you to hook into the Error Boundaries and gives you access to the error object.",
    "You can use this action if you want to get hold of the error object that‚Äôs handled by the boundaries, i.e to send them to an external error tracking tool.",
    "The Block Directory enables installing new block plugins from WordPress.org. It can be disabled by removing the actions that enqueue it. In WordPress core, the function is wp_enqueue_editor_block_directory_assets. To remove the feature, use remove_action, like this:",
    "Default true. The filter is checked when registering remote block patterns, set to false to disable.",
    "For example, to disable use:",
    "To modify the behavior of existing blocks, WordPress exposes several APIs.",
    "The following filters are available to extend the settings for blocks during their registration.",
    "Filters the raw metadata loaded from the block.json file when registering a block type on the server with PHP. It allows applying modifications before the metadata gets processed.",
    "The filter takes one param:",
    "Filters the settings determined from the processed block type metadata. It makes it possible to apply custom modifications using the block metadata that isn‚Äôt handled by default.",
    "The filter takes two params:",
    "Used to filter the block settings when registering the block on the client with JavaScript. It receives the block settings, the name of the registered block, and either null or the deprecated block settings (when applied to a registered deprecation) as arguments. This filter is also applied to each of a block‚Äôs deprecated settings.",
    "Ensure that List blocks are saved with the canonical generated class name (wp-block-list):",
    "The following filters are available to change the behavior of blocks while editing in the block editor.",
    "A filter that applies to the result of a block‚Äôs save function. This filter is used to replace or extend the element, for example using wp.element.cloneElement to modify the element‚Äôs props or replace its children, or returning an entirely new element.",
    "The filter‚Äôs callback receives an element, a block type definition object and the block attributes as arguments. It should return an element.",
    "Wraps a cover block into an outer container.",
    "A filter that applies to all blocks returning a WP Element in the save function. This filter is used to add extra props to the root element of the save function. For example: to add a className, an id, or any valid prop for this element.",
    "The filter receives the current save element‚Äôs props, a block type and the block attributes as arguments. It should return a props object.",
    "Adding a background by default to all blocks.",
    "Note: A block validation error will occur if this filter modifies existing content the next time the post is edited. The editor verifies that the content stored in the post matches the content output by the save() function.",
    "To avoid this validation error, use render_block server-side to modify existing post content instead of this filter. See render_block documentation.",
    "Generated HTML classes for blocks follow the wp-block-{name} nomenclature. This filter allows to provide an alternative class name.",
    "Used to filter an individual transform result from block transformation. All of the original blocks are passed since transformations are many-to-many, not one-to-one.",
    "Called immediately after the default parsing of a block‚Äôs attributes and before validation to allow a plugin to manipulate attribute values in time for validation and/or the initial values rendering of the block in the editor.",
    "Used to modify the block‚Äôs edit component. It receives the original block BlockEdit component and returns a new wrapped component.",
    "Used to modify the block‚Äôs wrapper component containing the block‚Äôs edit component and all toolbars. It receives the original BlockListBlock component and returns a new wrapped component.",
    "Adding new properties to the block‚Äôs wrapper component can be achieved by adding them to the wrapperProps property of the returned component.",
    "Adding blocks is easy enough, removing them is as easy. Plugin or theme authors have the possibility to ‚Äúunregister‚Äù blocks.",
    "and load this script in the Editor",
    "Important: When unregistering a block, there can be a race condition on which code runs first: registering the block, or unregistering the block. You want your unregister code to run last. The way to do that is specify the component that is registering the block as a dependency, in this case wp-edit-post. Additionally, using wp.domReady() ensures the unregister code runs once the dom is loaded.",
    "If you want to disable all blocks except an allow list, you can adapt the script above like so:",
    "Note: Before WordPress 5.8 known as allowed_block_types. In the case when you want to support older versions of WordPress you might need a way to detect which filter should be used ‚Äì the deprecated one vs the new one. The recommended way to proceed is to check if the WP_Block_Editor_Context class exists.",
    "On the server, you can filter the list of blocks shown in the inserter using the allowed_block_types_all filter. You can return either true (all block types supported), false (no block types supported), or an array of block type names to allow. You can also use the second provided param $editor_context to filter block types based on its content.",
    "Note: Before WordPress 5.8 known as block_categories. In the case when you want to support older versions of WordPress you might need a way to detect which filter should be used ‚Äì the deprecated one vs the new one. The recommended way to proceed is to check if the WP_Block_Editor_Context class exists.",
    "It is possible to filter the list of default block categories using the block_categories_all filter. You can do it on the server by implementing a function which returns a list of categories. It is going to be used during blocks registration and to group blocks in the inserter. You can also use the second provided param $editor_context to filter the based on its content.",
    "You can also display an icon with your block category by setting an icon attribute. The value can be the slug of a WordPress Dashicon.",
    "You can also set a custom icon in SVG format. To do so, the icon should be rendered and set on the frontend, so it can make use of WordPress SVG, allowing mobile compatibility and making the icon more accessible.",
    "To set an SVG icon for the category shown in the previous example, add the following example JavaScript code to the editor calling wp.blocks.updateCategory e.g:",
    "Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code. They provide one way for plugins and themes to interact with the editor, but they‚Äôre also used extensively by WordPress Core itself.",
    "There are two types of hooks: Actions and Filters. In addition to PHP actions and filters, WordPress also provides a mechanism for registering and executing hooks in JavaScript. This functionality is also available on npm as the @wordpress/hooks package, for general purpose use.",

    "Block Variations is the API that allows a block to have similar versions of it, but all these versions share some common functionality. Each block variation is differentiated from the others by setting some initial attributes or inner blocks. Then at the time when a block is inserted these attributes and/or inner blocks are applied.",
    "A great way to understand this API better is by using the embed block as an example. The numerous existing variations for embed (WordPress, Youtube, etc..) share the same functionality for editing, saving, and so on, but their basic difference is the providerNameSlug attribute‚Äôs value, which defines the provider that needs to be used.",
    "By default, all variations will show up in the Inserter in addition to the regular block type item. However, setting the isDefault flag for any of the variations listed will override the regular block type in the Inserter.",
    "An object describing a variation defined for the block type can contain the following fields:",
    "The main difference between block styles and block variations is that a block style just applies a CSS class to the block, so it can be styled in an alternative way. If we want to apply initial attributes or inner blocks, we fall in block variation territory.",
    "It‚Äôs also possible to override the default block style using the className attribute when defining block variations.",
    "It‚Äôs worth mentioning that setting the isActive property can be useful for cases you want to use information from the block variation, after a block‚Äôs creation. For example, this API is used in useBlockDisplayInformation hook to fetch and display proper information on places like the BlockCard or Breadcrumbs components.",
    "Block variations can be declared during a block‚Äôs registration by providing the variations key with a proper array of variations, as defined above. In addition, there are ways to register and unregister a block variation for a block, after its registration.",

    "A block declares which transformations it supports via the optional transforms key of the block configuration, whose subkeys to and from hold an array of available transforms for every direction. Example:",
    "This section goes through the existing types of transformations blocks support:",
    "This type of transformations support both from and to directions, allowing blocks to be converted into a different one. It has a corresponding UI control within the block toolbar.",
    "A transformation of type block is an object that takes the following parameters:",
    "Example: from Paragraph block to Heading block",
    "To declare this transformation we add the following code into the heading block configuration, which uses the createBlock function from the wp-blocks package.",
    "Example: blocks that have InnerBlocks",
    "A block with InnerBlocks can also be transformed from and to another block with InnerBlocks.",
    "This type of transformations support the from direction, allowing blocks to be created from some content introduced by the user. They‚Äôre applied in a new block line after the user has introduced some content and hit the ENTER key.",
    "A transformation of type enter is an object that takes the following parameters:",
    "Example: from ‚Äî to Separator block",
    "To create a separator block when the user types the hypen three times and then hits the ENTER key we can use the following code:",

    "Starting in WordPress 5.8 release, we recommend using the block.json metadata file as the canonical way to register block types with both PHP (server-side) and JavaScript (client-side). Here is an example block.json file that would define the metadata for a plugin create a notice block.",
    "The block definition allows code sharing between JavaScript, PHP, and other languages when processing block types stored as JSON, and registering blocks with the block.json metadata file provides multiple benefits on top of it.",
    "From a performance perspective, when themes support lazy loading assets, blocks registered with block.json will have their asset enqueuing optimized out of the box. The frontend CSS and JavaScript assets listed in the style or script properties will only be enqueued when the block is present on the page, resulting in reduced page sizes.",
    "Furthermore, because the Block Type REST API Endpoint can only list blocks registered on the server, registering blocks server-side is recommended; using the block.json file simplifies this registration.",
    "The WordPress Plugins Directory can detect block.json files, highlight blocks included in plugins, and extract their metadata. If you wish to submit your block(s) to the Block Directory, all blocks contained in your plugin must have a block.json file for the Block Directory to recognize them.",

In addition, this property can be defined with JavaScript as an object containing background and foreground colors.

    "When registering a block with JavaScript on the client, the edit and save functions provide the interface for how a block is going to be rendered within the editor, how it will operate and be manipulated, and how it will be saved.",
    "The edit function describes the structure of your block in the context of the editor. This represents what the editor will render when the block is used.",
    "The first thing to notice here is the use of the useBlockProps React hook on the block wrapper element. In the example above, the block wrapper renders a ‚Äúdiv‚Äù in the editor, but in order for the Gutenberg editor to know how to manipulate the block, add any extra classNames that are needed for the block‚Ä¶ the block wrapper element should apply props retrieved from the useBlockProps react hook call. The block wrapper element should be a native DOM element, like <div> and <table>, or a React component that forwards any additional props to native DOM elements. Using a <Fragment> or <ServerSideRender> component, for instance, would be invalid.",
    "If the element wrapper needs any extra custom HTML attributes, these need to be passed as an argument to the useBlockProps hook. For example to add a my-random-classname className to the wrapper, you can use the following code:",
    "The edit function also receives a number of properties through an object argument. You can use these properties to adapt the behavior of your block.",
    "The attributes property surfaces all the available attributes and their corresponding values, as described by the attributes property when the block type was registered. See attributes documentation for how to specify attribute sources.",
    "In this case, assuming we had defined an attribute of content during block registration, we would receive and use that value in our edit function:",
    "The value of attributes.content will be displayed inside the div when inserting the block in the editor.",
    "The isSelected property is an boolean that communicates whether the block is currently selected.",
    "This function allows the block to update individual attributes based on user interactions.",
    "When using attributes that are objects or arrays it‚Äôs a good idea to copy or clone the attribute prior to updating it:",
    "Why do this? In JavaScript, arrays and objects are passed by reference, so this practice ensures changes won‚Äôt affect other code that might hold references to the same data. Furthermore, the Gutenberg project follows the philosophy of the Redux library that state should be immutable‚Äîdata should not be changed directly, but instead a new version of the data created containing the changes.",
    "The save function defines the way in which the different attributes should be combined into the final markup, which is then serialized into post_content.",
    "For most blocks, the return value of save should be an instance of WordPress Element representing how the block is to appear on the front of the site.",
    "Note: While it is possible to return a string value from save, it will be escaped. If the string includes HTML markup, the markup will be shown on the front of the site verbatim, not as the equivalent HTML node content. If you must return raw HTML from save, use wp.element.RawHTML. As the name implies, this is prone to cross-site scripting and therefore is discouraged in favor of a WordPress Element hierarchy whenever possible.",
    "Note: The save function should be a pure function that depends only on the attributes used to invoke it.\nIt can not have any side effect or retrieve information from another source, e.g. it is not possible to use the data module inside it select( store ).selector( ... ).\nThis is because if the external information changes, the block may be flagged as invalid when the post is later edited (read more about Validation).\nIf there is a need to have other information as part of the save, developers can consider one of these two alternatives:",
    "For dynamic blocks, the return value of save could represent a cached copy of the block‚Äôs content to be shown only in case the plugin implementing the block is ever disabled.",
    "If left unspecified, the default implementation will save no markup in post content for the dynamic block, instead deferring this to always be calculated when the block is shown on the front of the site.",
    "Like the edit function, when rendering static blocks, it‚Äôs important to add the block props returned by useBlockProps.save() to the wrapper element of your block. This ensures that the block class name is rendered properly in addition to any HTML attribute injected by the block supports API.",
    "As with edit, the save function also receives an object argument including attributes which can be inserted into the markup.",
    "When saving your block, you want to save the attributes in the same format specified by the attribute source definition. If no attribute source is specified, the attribute will be saved to the block‚Äôs comment delimiter. See the Block Attributes documentation for more details.",
    "Here are a couple examples of using attributes, edit, and save all together. For a full working example, see the Introducing Attributes and Editable Fields section of the Block Tutorial.",
    "Ideally, the attributes saved should be included in the markup. However, there are times when this is not practical, so if no attribute source is specified the attribute is serialized and saved to the block‚Äôs comment delimiter.",
    "This example could be for a dynamic block, such as the Latest Posts block, which renders the markup server-side. The save function is still required, however in this case it simply returns null since the block is not saving content from the editor.",
    "When the editor loads, all blocks within post content are validated to determine their accuracy in order to protect against content loss. This is closely related to the saving implementation of a block, as a user may unintentionally remove or modify their content if the editor is unable to restore a block correctly. During editor initialization, the saved markup for each block is regenerated using the attributes that were parsed from the post‚Äôs content. If the newly-generated markup does not match what was already stored in post content, the block is marked as invalid. This is because we assume that unless the user makes edits, the markup should remain identical to the saved content.",

    "I‚Äôm a plugin author. What should I do to debug why my blocks are being marked as invalid?",
    "Before starting to debug, be sure to familiarize yourself with the validation step described above documenting the process for detecting whether a block is invalid. A block is invalid if its regenerated markup does not match what is saved in post content, so often this can be caused by the attributes of a block being parsed incorrectly from the saved content.",
    "If you‚Äôre using attribute sources, be sure that attributes sourced from markup are saved exactly as you expect, and in the correct type (usually a 'string' or 'number').",
    "When a block is detected as invalid, a warning will be logged into your browser‚Äôs developer tools console. The warning will include specific details about the exact point at which a difference in markup occurred. Be sure to look closely at any differences in the expected and actual markups to see where problems are occurring.",

    "Refer to the guide on Deprecated Blocks to learn more about how to accommodate legacy content in intentional markup changes.",
    "This page provides a comprehensive guide to the principles and usage of the Deprecation API. For an introduction check out the tutorial on the basics of block deprecation which can be found on the Developer Blog.",
    "When updating static blocks markup and attributes, block authors need to consider existing posts using the old versions of their block. To provide a good upgrade path, you can choose one of the following strategies:",
    "A block can have several deprecated versions. A deprecation will be tried if the current state of a parsed block is invalid, or if the deprecation defines an isEligible function that returns true.",
    "Deprecations do not operate as a chain of updates in the way other software data updates, like database migrations, do. At first glance, it is easy to think that each deprecation is going to make the required changes to the data and then hand this new form of the block onto the next deprecation to make its changes. What happens instead is:",
    "It is important to note that if a deprecation‚Äôs save method does not produce a valid block then it is skipped completely, including its migrate method, even if isEligible would return true for the given attributes. This means that if you have several deprecations for a block and want to perform a new migration, like moving content to InnerBlocks, you may need to update the migrate methods in multiple deprecations in order for the required changes to be applied to all previous versions of the block.",
    "It is also important to note that if a deprecation‚Äôs save method imports additional functions from other files, changes to those files may accidentally change the behavior of the deprecation. You may want to add a snapshot copy of these functions to the deprecations file instead of importing them in order to avoid inadvertently breaking the deprecations.",
    "For blocks with multiple deprecations, it may be easier to save each deprecation to a constant with the version of the block it applies to, and then add each of these to the block‚Äôs deprecated array. The deprecations in the array should be in reverse chronological order. This allows the block editor to attempt to apply the most recent and likely deprecations first, avoiding unnecessary and expensive processing.",
    "It is also recommended to keep fixtures which contain the different versions of the block content to allow you to easily test that new deprecations and migrations are working across all previous versions of the block.",
    "Deprecations are defined on a block type as its deprecated property, an array of deprecation objects where each object takes the form:",
    "It‚Äôs important to note that attributes, supports, and save are not automatically inherited from the current version, since they can impact parsing and serialization of a block, so they must be defined on the deprecated object in order to be processed during a migration.",
    "In the example above we updated the markup of the block to use a div instead of p.",
    "Sometimes, you need to update the attributes set to rename or modify old attributes.",
    "In the example above we updated the markup of the block to use a div instead of p and rename the text attribute to content.",
    "Situations may exist where when migrating the block we may need to add or remove innerBlocks.\nE.g: a block wants to migrate a title attribute to a paragraph innerBlock.",
    "In the example above we updated the block to use an inner Paragraph block with a title instead of a title attribute.",
    "Above are example cases of block deprecation. For more, real-world examples, check for deprecations in the core block library. Core blocks have been updated across releases and contain simple and complex deprecations.",
    "Block context is a feature which enables ancestor blocks to provide values which can be consumed by descendent blocks within its own hierarchy. Those descendent blocks can inherit these values without resorting to hard-coded values and without an explicit awareness of the block which provides those values.",
    "This is especially useful in full-site editing where, for example, the contents of a block may depend on the context of the post in which it is displayed. A blogroll template may show excerpts of many different posts. Using block context, there can still be one single ‚ÄúPost Excerpt‚Äù block which displays the contents of the post based on an inherited post ID.",
    "If you are familiar with React Context, block context adopts many of the same ideas. In fact, the client-side block editor implementation of block context is a very simple application of React Context. Block context is also supported in server-side render_callback implementations, demonstrated in the examples below.",
    "Block context is defined in the registered settings of a block. A block can provide a context value, or consume a value it seeks to inherit.",
    "A block can provide a context value by assigning a providesContext property in its registered settings. This is an object which maps a context name to one of the block‚Äôs own attribute. The value corresponding to that attribute value is made available to descendent blocks and can be referenced by the same context name. Currently, block context only supports values derived from the block‚Äôs own attributes. This could be enhanced in the future to support additional sources of context values.",
    "For complete example, refer below section.",
    "As seen in the above example, it is recommended that you include a namespace as part of the name of the context key so as to avoid potential conflicts with other plugins or default context values provided by WordPress. The context namespace should be specific to your plugin, and in most cases can be the same as used in the name of the block itself.",
    "A block can inherit a context value from an ancestor provider by assigning a usesContext property in its registered settings. This should be assigned as an array of the context names the block seeks to inherit.",
    "Once a block has defined the context it seeks to inherit, this can be accessed in the implementation of edit (JavaScript) and render_callback (PHP). It is provided as an object (JavaScript) or associative array (PHP) of the context values which have been defined for the block. Note that a context value will only be made available if the block explicitly defines a desire to inherit that value.",

    "A block can contain any number of attributes, and these are specified by the attributes field ‚Äì an object where each key is the name of the attribute, and the value is the attribute definition.",

    "The block is responsible for using the save function to ensure that all attributes with a source field are saved according to the attributes definition. This is not automatic.",
    "Attributes without a source will be automatically saved in the block comment delimiter.",

This is typically used by RichText.\n‚Äì query ‚Äì data is stored as an array of objects.\n‚Äì meta ‚Äì data is stored in post meta (deprecated).",
    "The source field is usually combined with a selector field. If no selector argument is specified, the source definition runs against the block‚Äôs root node. If a selector argument is specified, it will run against the matching element(s) within the block.",

    "Under the hood, attribute sources are a superset of the functionality provided by hpq, a small library used to parse and query HTML markup into an object shape.",
    "To summarize, the source determines where data is stored in your content, and the type determines what that data is. To reduce the amount of data stored it is usually better to store as much data as possible within HTML rather than as attributes within the comment delimiter.",

This is necessary because blocks may have multiple rich text instances that are used to manage data for different attributes, so you need to pass this in order to highlight text within the correct one.",
    "For example the Paragraph block only has a single RichText instance, with the identifier content. The quote block type has 2 RichText instances, so if you wish to highlight text in the citation, you need to pass citation as the richTextIdentifier when adding an annotation. To target the quote content, you need to use the identifier value. Refer to the source code of the block type to find the correct identifier.",
    "It is also possible to annotate a block completely. In that case just provide the selector property and set it to block. The default selector is range, which can be used for text annotation.",
    "This doesn‚Äôt provide any styling out of the box, so you have to provide some CSS to make sure your annotation is shown:",
    "The text annotation is controlled by the start and end properties.

    "It is not for us to decide what is simple: it‚Äôs for the user to decide. If we say something is easy and the user doesn‚Äôt have an easy experience, it undermines their trust in us and what we‚Äôre building. The same goes for ‚Äújust‚Äù‚Äîmany of us know to avoid ‚Äúsimple,‚Äù but still use ‚Äújust‚Äù all the time. ‚ÄúJust click here.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust enter your username.‚Äù It‚Äôs the same thing: it implies that something will be no big deal, but we can‚Äôt know what the user will find to be a big deal.",
    "It‚Äôs also safer and more helpful to be specific. ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù and ‚Äúsimple‚Äù are shorthand for explanations that we haven‚Äôt written; whenever you see them, take a minute to think about what they‚Äôre standing in for. Maybe ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to add a block by hitting ‚Äòenter‚Äô‚Äù really means ‚ÄúYou can add more content to the page without taking your hands off the keyboard.‚Äù Great!

    "An automated job publishes the docs every 15 minutes to the block editor handbook site.",
    "See the Git Workflow documentation for how to use git to deploy changes using pull requests. Additionally, see the video walk-through and the accompanying slides for contributing documentation to Gutenberg.",
    "The handbook is organized into four sections based on the functional types of documents. The Documentation System does a great job explaining the needs and functions of each type, but in short they are:",
    "A how to guide template is available to provide a common structure to guides. If starting a new how to guide, copy the markdown from the template to get started.",
    "The template is based on examples from The Good Docs Project, see their template repository for additional examples to help you create quality documentation.",
    "To update an existing page:",
    "To add a new document requires a working JavaScript development environment to build the documentation, see the JavaScript build setup documentation:",
    "If you forget to run, npm run docs:build your PR will fail the static analysis check, since the manifest.json file is an uncommitted local change that must be committed.",
    "Package documentation is generated automatically by the documentation tool by pulling the contents of the README.md file located in the root of the package. Sometimes however, it is preferable to split the contents of the README out into smaller, easier to read portions.",
    "This can be accomplished by creating a docs directory in the package and adding toc.json file that contains references other markdown files also contained in the docs directory. The toc.json file should contain an array of pages to be added as sub-pages of the main README file. The formatting follows the manifest.json file that is generated automatically.",
    "In order for these pages to be nested under the main package name, be sure to set the parent property correctly. See the example below that adds child pages to the @wordpress/create-block section.",
    "It‚Äôs likely at some point you‚Äôll want to link to other internal documentation pages. It‚Äôs worth emphasizing all documents can be browsed in different contexts:",
    "To create links that work in all contexts, you must use absolute path links without the `https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg` prefix. You can reference files using the following patterns:",
    "This way they will be properly handled in all three aforementioned contexts.",
    "Use the full directory and filename from the Gutenberg repository, not the published path; the Block Editor Handbook creates short URLs‚Äîyou can see this in the tutorials section. Likewise, the readme.md portion is dropped in the handbook, but should be included in links.",
    "An example, the link to this page is: /docs/contributors/documentation/README.md",
    "The code example in markdown should be wrapped in three tick marks ``` and should additionally include a language specifier. See this GitHub documentation around fenced code blocks.",
    "A unique feature to the Gutenberg documentation is the codetabs toggle, this allows two versions of code to be shown at once. This is used for showing both JSX and Plain code samples. For example, on this block tutorial page.",
    "Here is an example codetabs section:",
    "The preferred format for code examples is JSX, this should be the default view. The example placed first in source will be shown as the default.",
    "Note: It is not required to include plain JavaScript code examples for every guide. The recommendation is to include plain code for beginner tutorials or short examples, but the majority of code in Gutenberg packages and across the larger React and JavaScript ecosystem are in JSX that requires a build process.",
    "The Block Editor handbook supports the same notice styles as other WordPress handbooks. However, the shortcode implementation is not ideal with the different locations the block editor handbook documentation is published (npm, GitHub).",
    "The recommended way to implement in markdown is to use the raw HTML and callout callout-LEVEL classes. For example:",
    "The following classes are available: info, tip, alert, warning",

    "At the core of Gutenberg lies the concept of the block. From a technical point of view, blocks both raise the level of abstraction from a single document to a collection of meaningful elements, and they replace ambiguity‚Äîinherent in HTML‚Äîwith explicit structure.",
    "From a user perspective, blocks allow any kind of content, media, or functionality to be directly added to their site in a more consistent and usable way. The ‚Äúadd block‚Äù button gives the user access to an entire library of options all in one place, rather than having to hunt through menus or know shortcodes.",
    "But most importantly, Gutenberg is built on the principle of direct manipulation, which means that the primary options for how an element is displayed are controlled in the context of the block itself. This is a big shift from the traditional WordPress model, where options that were often buried deep in layers of navigation menus controlled the elements on a page through indirect mechanisms.",
    "So, for example, a user can add an image, write its caption, change its width and layout, add a link around it, all from within the block interface in the canvas. The same principle should apply to more complex blocks, like a ‚Äúnavigation menu‚Äù, with the user being able to add, edit, move, and finalize the full presentation of their navigation.",
    "What does this mean for designers and developers? The block structure plus the principle of direct manipulation mean thinking differently about how to design and develop WordPress components. Let‚Äôs take another look at the architecture of a block:",
    "The placeholder content in the content area of the block can be thought of as a guide or interface for users to follow a set of instructions or ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù (more on placeholders later). Since the content area represents what will actually appear on the site, interaction here hews closest to the principle of direct manipulation and will be most intuitive to the user. This should be thought of as the primary interface for adding and manipulating content and adjusting how it is displayed.",
    "Basic block settings won‚Äôt always make sense in the context of the placeholder / content UI. As a secondary option, options that are critical to the functionality of a block can live in the block toolbar. The block toolbar is one step removed from direct manipulation, but is still highly contextual and visible on all screen sizes, so it is a great secondary option.",
    "The Settings Sidebar is not visible by default on a small / mobile screen, and may also be collapsed even in a desktop view. Therefore, it should not be relied on for anything that is necessary for the basic operation of the block. Pick good defaults, make important actions available in the block toolbar, and think of the sidebar as something that only power users may discover.",

    "In your JavaScript project, use hooks as follows:",
    "In the above example, we are creating a custom instance of the Hooks object and registering hooks there. The package also creates a default global instance that‚Äôs accessible through the defaultHooks named exports, and its methods are also separately exported one-by-one.",
    "In the WordPress context, that enables API functions to be called via the global wp.hooks object, like wp.hooks.addAction(), etc.",
    "One notable difference between the JS and PHP hooks API is that in the JS version, addAction() and addFilter() also need to include a namespace as the second argument. Namespace uniquely identifies a callback in the form vendor/plugin/function.",
    "Whenever an action or filter is added or removed, a matching hookAdded or hookRemoved action is triggered.",
    "In non-minified builds developers can register a filter or action that will be called on all hooks, for example: addAction( 'all', 'namespace', callbackFunction );. Useful for debugging, the code supporting the all hook is stripped from the production code for performance reasons.",
    "Slot and Fill are a pair of components which enable developers to render elsewhere in a React element tree, a pattern often referred to as ‚Äúportal‚Äù rendering. It is a pattern for component extensibility, where a single Slot may be occupied by an indeterminate number of Fills elsewhere in the application.",
    "Slot Fill is heavily inspired by the react-slot-fill library, but uses React‚Äôs own portal rendering API.",
    "At the root of your application, you must render a SlotFillProvider which coordinates Slot and Fill rendering.",
    "Then, render a Slot component anywhere in your application, giving it a name.",
    "Any Fill will automatically occupy this Slot space, even if rendered elsewhere in the application.",
    "You can either use the Fill component directly, or a wrapper component type as in the below example to abstract the slot name from consumer awareness.",
    "There is also createSlotFill helper method which was created to simplify the process of matching the corresponding Slot and Fill components:",
    "The SlotFillProvider component does not accept any props.",
    "Both Slot and Fill accept a name string prop, where a Slot with a given name will render the children of any associated Fills.",

    "From the kickoff post:",
    "The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has ‚Äúblocks‚Äù to make easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or ‚Äúmystery meat‚Äù embed discovery.",
    "We can extract a few key principles from this:",
    "One thing that sets WordPress apart from other systems is that it allows users to create as rich a post layout as they can imagine ‚Äî as long as they know HTML and CSS and build a custom theme.",
    "Gutenberg reshapes the editor into a tool that allows users to write rich posts and build beautiful layouts in a few clicks ‚Äî no technical knowledge needed. WordPress will become a powerful and flexible content tool that‚Äôs accessible to all.",
    "Gutenberg wants to make it easier to author rich content. This means ensuring good defaults, bundling advanced layout options into blocks, and making the most important actions immediately available. Authoring content with WordPress should be accessible to anyone.",
    "Everything on a WordPress website becomes a block: text, images, galleries, widgets, shortcodes, and even chunks of custom HTML, whether added by plugins or otherwise. Users will only have to learn a single interface ‚Äî‚Äî the block interface.",
    "All blocks are created equal. They all live in the same inserter interface. Recency, search, tabs, and grouping ensure that the most-used blocks are within easy reach.",
    "Drag-and-drop is secondary. For greater accessibility and platform compatibility, drag-and-drop interactions are used as an additive enhancement on top of explicit actions like click, tab, and space.",
    "Placeholders are key. If a block can have a neutral placeholder state, it should. An image placeholder block shows a button to open the media library, and a text placeholder block shows a writing prompt. By embracing placeholders we can predefine editable layouts, so all users have to do is fill in the blanks.",
    "Direct manipulation is intuitive. The block interface allows users to manipulate content directly on the page. Plugin and theme authors will support and extend this experience by building their own custom blocks.",
    "Code editing shouldn‚Äôt be necessary for customization. Customizing traditionally required complicated markup, and complicated markup is easy to break. With Gutenberg, customizing becomes more intuitive ‚Äî and safer. A developer will be able to provide custom blocks that directly render portions of a layout (a three column grid of features, for instance) and clearly specify what can be directly edited by the user. That means the user can update text, swap images, reduce the number of columns, without having to ask a developer, or worrying about breaking things.",
    "The initial phase of Gutenberg as described in the kickoff goal is primarily limited to the content area (specifically post_content) of posts and pages. Within those confines, we are embracing the web as a vertical river of content by appending blocks sequentially, then adding layout options to each block.",
    "That said, there isn‚Äôt any fixed limit to the kind of layouts Gutenberg will be able to create. It‚Äôs very possible for Gutenberg to grow beyond the confines of post and page content, to include the whole page ‚Äî one could think of a theme template as a comma-separated list of blocks, like this:",
    "Every block nested inside the content block would be rearrangeable. Every block would be editable. Every block would use the same API, and both the editor and the theme would load the same style.css file directly. In the end, both the editor/page builder and theme/front-end would appear near-identical, allowing for a true WYSIWYG experience.",
    "This concept is speculative, but it‚Äôs one direction Gutenberg could go in the future.",

    "Regarding the first type, these strings are translated following the same process described for the web version in this guide, however for the latter, it‚Äôs required to provide your own translations.",
    "In order to identify these strings, you can use the script extract-used-strings located in packages/react-native-editor/bin/extract-used-strings.js to generate a JSON object that contains all the strings referenced including the platforms where they are used, as well as the files that reference it. Here you can see the format:",
    "This command also supports passing extra plugins, in case the React Native bundle of the editor is generated including other plugins.",
    "It‚Äôs important to note that the JSON object contains all used strings, so in order to identify the ones only used in the native platform, it‚Äôs required to provide your own script/process to extract them. This can easily be done by going through the strings and filtering out the ones that include the ‚Äúweb‚Äù platform.",
    "Extract used strings:",
    "NOTE: We need to pass absolute paths, otherwise it uses packages/react-native-editor as root path for relative paths.",
    "Extract used strings including extra plugins:",
    "Once you have the list of used strings in the native platform, the strings have to be translated, however, this process is out of the scope of the native version so you have to provide your own translations.",
    "The process for injecting the translations data into the editor is via the translations initial prop which is passed to the editor during its initialization:\n‚Äì Android reference\n‚Äì iOS reference",
    "The mechanism for integrating the provided translations to the mobile client, via the mentioned translations initial prop, is not described here, as it‚Äôs specific to the mobile client and could be achieved in different ways. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs important that they‚Äôre provided by the mentioned initial prop, as the editor is in charge of merging them with the translations already included in the editor.",
    "NOTE: Keep in mind that those strings that match with ones already included in the editor will be overridden.",
    "A translation file is basically a JSON object that contains key-value items with the translation for each individual string. This content is fetched from translate.wordpress.org that holds translations for WordPress and a list of different plugins like Gutenberg.",

In our case, the parts that we want to test are the different components that are required to be rendered for a specific block or editor logic. In the end, they are very similar to unit tests as they are run with the same command using the Jest library.

    "We also include examples of common tasks as well as tips in the following sections:",

    "Before introducing the testing logic, we have to render the components that we want to test on. Depending on if we want to use the scoped component or entire editor approach, this part will be different.",
    "Here is an example of rendering the Cover block (extracted from this code):",
    "Here is an example of rendering the Buttons block (extracted from this code):",
    "Once the components are rendered, it‚Äôs time to query them. An important note about this topic is that we should test from the user‚Äôs perspective, this means that ideally we should query by elements that the user has access to like texts or accessibility labels.",
    "When querying we should follow this priority order:",
    "Here are some examples:",
    "Note that either a plain string or a regular expression can be passed into these queries. A regular expression is best for querying part of a string (e.g. any element whose accessibility label contains Unsupported Block. Row 1). Note that special characters such as . need to be escaped.",
    "After rendering the components or firing an event, side effects might happen due to potential state updates so the element we‚Äôre looking for might not be yet rendered. In this case, we would need to wait for the element to be available and for this purpose, we can use the waitFor function, which periodically executes the provided callback to determine whether the element appeared or not.",
    "In most cases we‚Äôll use the waitFor function, but it‚Äôs important to note that it should be restricted to those queries that actually require waiting for the element to be available.",
    "NOTE: The react-native-testing-library package provides the query* and find* functions for this purpose too, but we should avoid using them for now because there‚Äôs a known issue that would make the test fail.",
    "It‚Äôs also possible to query elements contained in other elements via the within function, here is an example:",
    "As important as querying an element is to trigger events to simulate the user interaction, for this purpose we can use the fireEvent function (documentation).",
    "Here is an example of a press event:",

    "Additionally when rendering the entire editor, we can also verify if the HTML output is what we expect:",
    "And finally, we have to clean up any potential modifications we‚Äôve made that could affect the following tests. Here is an example of a typical cleanup after registering blocks that implies unregistering all blocks:",
    "In the spirit of making easier writing integration tests for the native version, you can find a list of helper functions in this README.",

    "See examples:",
    "The FlatList component renders its items depending on the scroll position, the view and content size. This means that when rendering this component it might happen that some of the items can‚Äôt be queried because they haven‚Äôt been rendered yet.

    "Sliders found in bottom sheets should be queried using their testID:",
    "Note that a slider‚Äôs testID is ‚ÄúSlider ‚Äù + label. So for a slider with a label of ‚ÄúBorder Radius‚Äù, testID is ‚ÄúSlider Border Radius‚Äù.",
    "One caveat when adding blocks is that if they contain inner blocks, these inner blocks are not rendered. The following example shows how we can make a Buttons block render its inner Button blocks (assumes we‚Äôve already obtained a reference to the Buttons block as buttonsBlock):",
    "If you have trouble locating an element‚Äôs identifier, you may wish to use Xcode‚Äôs Accessibility Inspector. Most identifiers are cross-platform, so even though the tests are run on Android by default, the Accessibility Inspector can be used to find the right identifier.",
    "Omitting the await before a waitFor can lead to scenarios where tests pass but are not testing the intended behaviour. For example, if toBeDefined is used to assert the result of a call to waitFor, the assertion will pass because waitFor returns a value, even though it is not the ReactTestInstance we meant to check for. For this reason, it is recommended to use the custom matcher toBeVisible which guards against this type of false positive.",
    "The default timeout for the waitFor function is set to 1000 ms, so far this value is enough for all the render logic we‚Äôre testing, however, if while testing we notice that an element requires more time to be rendered we should increase it.",

    "This will trigger a GitHub Actions (GHA) workflow that bumps the plugin version, builds the Gutenberg plugin .zip file, creates a release draft, and attaches the plugin .zip file to it. This part of the process typically takes a little under six minutes. You‚Äôll see that workflow appear at the top of the list, right under the blue banner. Once it‚Äôs finished, it‚Äôll change its status icon from a yellow dot to a green checkmark. You can follow along in a more detailed view by clicking on the workflow.",
    "As part of the release candidate (RC) process, all of the @wordpress packages are published to NPM. You may see messaging after the ‚ÄúBuild Gutenberg Plugin Zip‚Äù action action has created the draft release that the ‚ÄúPublish npm packages‚Äù action requires someone with appropriate permissions to trigger the action.",
    "This message is misleading and no action is required by the release coordinator. The process is automated and it will automatically run after the release notes are published.",
    "As soon as the workflow has finished, you‚Äôll find the release draft under Gutenberg Releases. The draft is pre-populated with changelog entries based on previous release candidates for this version and any changes that have since been cherry-picked to the release branch. Thus, when releasing the first stable version of a series, delete any RC version headers (that are only there for your information) and move the more recent changes to the correct section (see below).",
    "The changelog draft will be partially pre-organized (based on GitHub labels) into sections and, within those, into ‚Äúfeatures.‚Äù Take some time to read the generated notes and then edit them to ensure legibility and accuracy.",
    "Don‚Äôt rush this part. It‚Äôs important to ensure the release notes are as organized as possible, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be completed in one go. You can save the draft and come back to it later.",
    "When editing the notes, you should be sure to:",
    "You can find some more tips on writing the release notes and post in the section below.",
    "At any point after the release candidate has been published but before the final stable release, some bugs related to this release might be fixed and committed to trunk. These fixes won‚Äôt automatically be incorporated into the final stable release, including them is a manual process.",
    "There are a couple of ways a release coordinator might be made aware of these bugs:",
    "The cherry-picking process is handled as follows:",
    "Once the commits have been cherry-picked, remove the Backport to Gutenberg RC label and update the milestone to the current release for all cherry-picked PRs.",
    "If you decide that the fixes deserve another release candidate before the stable version is published, create one by following the instructions above. Let other contributors know that a new release candidate has been released in the #core-editor Slack channel.",
    "Only once you‚Äôre happy with the shape of the release notes, press the green ‚ÄúPublish release‚Äù button. This will create a git tag for the version, publish the release, and trigger another GHA workflow with a twofold purpose:",
    "The last step needs approval by a member of the Gutenberg Core team. Locate the ‚ÄúUpload Gutenberg plugin to WordPress.org plugin repo‚Äù workflow for the new version, and have it approved.",
    "Once approved, the new Gutenberg version will be available to WordPress users all over the globe. You should check that folks can install the latest version from their WordPress Dashboard.",
    "Once released, all that‚Äôs left to do is writing a release post on make.wordpress.org/core. You can find some tips on that below.",
    "The release notes draft is auto-generated by a script that looks for pull requests for the current milestone, and:",
    "This is intended to be a starting point for release notes, and manually reviewing and curating the changelog entries is still required. The release candidate changelog is reused in the stable release and greatly helps select the highlights; because depending on the release it can be a very time-consuming process, it is recommended to start this process as soon as the milestone is closed and the release candidate is published.",
    "Guidelines for proof-reading include:",
    "Once the changelog is cleaned up, the next step is to choose a few changes to highlight in the release post. These highlights usually focus on new features and enhancements, including performance and accessibility ones, but can also include important API changes or critical bug fixes.",
    "Given the big scope of Gutenberg and the high number of pull requests merged in each milestone, it is not uncommon to overlook impactful changes worth highlighting; because of this, this step is a collaborative effort between the release manager, design, and Gutenberg Core team members.",
    "Because of the nature of the release post content, responsibilities are divided in this step. While the post can either be drafted by the release manager or delegated to another core member agreed upon in advance, visual assets are created by the design team.",
    "When possible, the highlighted changes in the release post should include an animation (video or GIF) or a static image of them in use. Choosing between an animation or a static image will depend on the best way to showcase each highlight: while animations are better to demonstrate workflows, more direct highlights can be shown with an image; having too many video players adds a layer of friction for users to see the highlight, whereas too many simultaneous animated GIFs can distract and overwhelm the reader.",
    "These visual assets should maintain consistency with previous release posts; using lean, white themes helps in this regard and visually integrate well with the make.wordpress.org/core blog aesthetics. Including copyrighted material should be avoided, and browser plugins that can be seen in the browser canvas (spell checkers, form fillers, etc.) disabled when capturing the assets.",
    "The post should also include a performance audit at the end, comparing the current Gutenberg release with both the previous one and the latest WordPress major version. There are GitHub worfklows in place to do this comparison as part of the Continuous Integration setup, so the performance audit results can be found at the workflow run generated by the release commit in the Performance Tests workflows page, with the job name Compare performance with current WordPress Core and previous Gutenberg versions.",
    "If the GitHub workflow fails, the performance audit can be executed locally using bin/plugin/cli.js perf and passing the branches to run the performance suite against as parameters. In addition, the current major WP version can be passed to avoid running tests against the WP trunk. Example:",
    "The performance values usually displayed in the release post are:",
    "Once the post content is ready, an author already having permissions to post in make.wordpress.org/core will create a new draft and import the content; this post should be published after the actual release, helping external media to echo and amplify the release news. Remember asking for peer review is encouraged by the make/core posting guidelines!",
    "Occasionally it‚Äôs necessary to create a minor release (i.e. X.Y.Z) of the Plugin. This is usually done to expedite fixes for bad regressions or bugs. The Backport to Gutenberg Minor Release is usually used to identify PRs that need to be included in a minor release, but as release coordinator you may also be notified more informally through slack. Even so, it‚Äôs good to ensure all relevant PRs have the correct label.",
    "As you proceed with the following process, it‚Äôs worth bearing in mind that such minor releases are not created as branches in their own right (e.g. release/12.5.0) but are simply tags.",
    "The method for minor releases is nearly identical to the main Plugin release process (see above) but has some notable exceptions. Please make sure to read the whole of this guide before proceeding.",
    "The minor release should only contain the specific commits required. To do this you should checkout the previous major stable (i.e. non-RC) release branch (e.g. release/12.5) locally and then cherry pick any commits that you require into that branch.",
    "The cherry-picking process can be automated with the npm run cherry-pick script, but be sure to use the Backport to Gutenberg Minor Release label when running the script.",
    "You must also ensure that all PRs being included are assigned to the Github Milestone on which the minor release is based. Bear in mind, that when PRs are merged they are automatically assigned a milestone for the next stable release. Therefore you will need to go back through each PR in Github and re-assign the Milestone.",
    "For example, if you are releasing version 12.5.4, then all PRs picked for that release must be unassigned from the 12.6 Milestone and instead assigned to the 12.5 Milestone.",
    "Once cherry picking is complete, you can also remove the Backport to Gutenberg Minor Release label from the PRs.",
    "Once you have the stable release branch in order and the correct Milestone assigned to your PRs you can push the branch to Github and continue with the release process using the Github website GUI.",
    "Go to Gutenberg‚Äôs GitHub repository‚Äôs Actions tab, and locate the ‚ÄúBuild Gutenberg Plugin Zip‚Äù action. You should now carefully choose the next action based on information about the current Plugin release version:",
    "If the previous release version was stable (X.Y.Z ‚Äì e.g. 12.5.0, 12.5.1 .etc) leave the Use workflow from field as trunk and then specify stable in the text input field. The workflow will automatically create a minor release, with z incremented (x.y.(z+1)) as required.",
    "If however, the previous release was an RC (e.g. X.Y.0-rc.1) you will need to manually select the stable version‚Äôs release branch (e.g. 12.5.0) when creating the release. Failure to do this will cause the workflow to release the next major stable version (e.g. 12.6.0) which is not what you want.",
    "To do this, when running the Workflow, select the appropriate release/ branch from the Use workflow from dropdown (e.g. release/12.5) and specify stable in the text input field.",
    "Please note you cannot create minor releases for previous stable releases once a more recent stable release has been published as this would require significant changes to how we upload plugin versions to the WP.org plugin SVN repo). Always check the latest release version before you proceed (see this Issue for more information).",

    "If you forget to assign the correct Milestone to your cherry picked PR(s) then the changelog may not be generated as you would expect.",
    "It is important to always manually verify that the PRs shown in the changelog match up with those cherry picked to the release branch.",
    "Moreover, if the release includes only a single PR, then failing to assign the PR to the correct Milestone will cause an error to be displayed when generating the changelog. In this case you can edit the release notes to include details of the missing PR (manually copying the format from a previous release).",
    "If for any reason the Milestone has been closed, you may reopen it for the purposes of the release.",
    "The draft release only contains 1 asset file. Other releases have x3.",
    "This is expected. The draft release will contain only the plugin zip. Only once the release is published will the remaining assets be generated and added to the release.",
    "Do I need to publish point releases to WordPress.org?",
    "Yes. The method for this is identical to the main Plugin release process. You will need a Gutenberg Core team member to approve the release workflow.",
    "The release process failed to cherry-pick version bump commit to the trunk branch.",
    "First, confirm that the step failed by checking the latest commits on trunk do not include the version bump commit. Then revert the version bump commit on the release branch ‚Äì git revert --no-edit {commitHash}. Finally, push the changes and start the release process again.",

    "For each Gutenberg plugin release, we also publish to npm an updated version of WordPress packages. This is automated with the Release Tool that handles releases for the Gutenberg plugin. A successful RC1 release triggers the npm publishing job, and this needs to be approved by a Gutenberg Core team member. Locate the ‚ÄúBuild Gutenberg Plugin Zip‚Äù workflow for the new version, and have it approved.",
    "We deliberately update the wp/latest branch within the Gutenberg repo with the content from the Gutenberg release release/X.Y (example release/12.7) branch at the time of the Gutenberg RC1 release. This is done to ensure that the wp/latest branch is as close as possible to the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin. It also practically removes the chances of conflicts while backporting to trunk commits with updates applied during publishing to package.json and CHANGELOG.md files. In the past, we had many issues in that aspect when doing npm publishing after the regular Gutenberg release a week later. When publishing the new package versions to npm, we pick at least the minor version bump to account for future bugfix or security releases.",

This means that when choosing npm package versions targeting these two releases, you won‚Äôt be able to use the next patch version number as it may have been already used. You should use the ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù modifier for these. For example, if the last published package version for this WordPress branch was 5.6.1, choose 5.6.1+patch.1 as a version.",

Ideally, E2E tests should be self-documented and readable to end users; in the end, they are trying to resemble how end users interact with the app. However, there are a couple of red flags in the code.",
    "Popularized by Jest, snapshot testing is a great tool to help test our app when it makes sense. However, probably because it‚Äôs so powerful, it‚Äôs often overused by developers. There are already multiple articles about this. In this particular case, snapshot testing fails to reflect the developer‚Äôs intention. It‚Äôs not clear what the assertions are about without looking into other information. This makes the code harder to understand and creates a mental overhead for all the other readers other than the one who wrote it. As readers, we have to jump around the code to fully understand them. The added complexity of the code discourages contributors from changing the test to fit their needs. It could sometimes even confuse the authors and make them accidentally commit the wrong snapshots.",
    "Here‚Äôs the same test with the test title and comments. Now you know what these assertions are actually about.",
    "The developer‚Äôs intention is a bit more readable, but it still feels disconnected from the test. You might be tempted to try inline snapshots, which do solve the issue of having to jump around files, but they‚Äôre still not self-documented nor explicit. We can do better.",
    "Instead of writing the assertions in comments, we can try directly writing them out explicitly. With the help of editor.getBlocks, we can rewrite them into simpler and atomic assertions.",
    "These assertions are more readable and explicit. You can add additional assertions or split existing ones into multiple ones to highlight their importance. Whether to keep the comments is up to you, but it‚Äôs usually fine to omit them when the code is already readable without them.",
    "Due to the lack of inline snapshots in Playwright, some migrated tests are using string assertions (toBe) to simulate similar effects without having to create dozens of snapshot files.",
    "We can consider this pattern as a variant of snapshot testing, and we should follow the same rule when writing them. It‚Äôs often better to rewrite them using editor.getBlocks or other methods to make explicit assertions.",
    "Comparing the explicit assertions to snapshot testing, we‚Äôre definitely losing some test coverage in this test. Snapshot testing is still useful when we want to assert the full serialized content of the block. Fortunately, though, some tests in the integration test already assert the full content of each core block. They run in Node.js, making them way faster than repeating the same test in Playwright. Running 273 test cases in my machine only costs about 5.7 seconds. These sorts of tests work great at the unit or integration level, and we can run them much faster without losing test coverage.",
    "Snapshot testing should rarely be required in E2E tests, often there are better alternatives that leverage explicit assertions. For times when there isn‚Äôt any other suitable alternative, we should follow the best practices when using them.",
    "Huge snapshots are hard to read and difficult to review. Moreover, when everything is important then nothing is important. Huge snapshots prevent us from focusing on the important parts of the snapshots.",

Some examples of utils that deserve to be implemented in the e2e-test-utils-playwright package include complex browser APIs (like pageUtils.dragFiles and pageUtils.pressKeys) and APIs that set states (requestUtils.*).",

Otherwise, only create an util if the action is complex and repetitive enough.",
    "As mentioned above, Page Object Model is the preferred way to create reusable utility functions on a certain page.",
    "The rationale behind using a POM is to group utils under namespaces to be easier to discover and use. In fact, PageUtils in the e2e-test-utils-playwright package is also a POM, which avoids the need for global variables, and utils can reference each other with this.",
    "It‚Äôs slow to set states manually before or after tests, especially when they‚Äôre repeated multiple times between tests. It‚Äôs recommended to set them via API calls. Use requestUtils.rest and requestUtils.batchRest instead to call the REST API (and add them to requestUtils if needed). We should still add a test for manually setting them, but that should only be tested once.",
    "Previously in our Jest + Puppeteer E2E tests, page and browser are exposed as global variables. This makes it harder to work with when we have multiple pages/tabs in the same test, or if we want to run multiple tests in parallel. @playwright/test has the concept of fixtures which allows us to inject page, browser, and other parameters into the tests.",
    "We can insert as many assertions in one test as needed. It‚Äôs better to make explicit assertions whenever possible. For instance, if we want to assert that a button exists before clicking on it, we can do expect( locator ).toBeVisible() before performing locator.click(). This makes the tests flow better and easier to read",
    "By default, tests are only run in chromium. You can tag tests to run them in different browsers. Use @browser anywhere in the test title to run it in that browser.

In the end, they are very similar to unit tests as they are run with the same command using the Jest library. The main difference is that for the integration tests the blocks are run within a special instance of the block editor.",
    "The advantage of this approach is that the bulk of a block editor‚Äôs functionality (block toolbar and inspector panel interactions, etc.) can be tested without having to fire up the full e2e test framework. This means the tests can run much faster and more reliably.

    "Historically, Gutenberg has used the __experimental and __unstable prefixes to indicate that a given API is not yet stable and may be subject to change. This is a legacy convention which should be avoided in favor of the plugin-only API pattern or a private API pattern described below.",
    "The problem with using the prefixes was that these APIs rarely got stabilized or removed. As of June 2022, WordPress Core contained 280 publicly exported experimental APIs merged from the Gutenberg plugin during the major WordPress releases. Many plugins and themes started relying on these experimental APIs for essential features that couldn‚Äôt be accessed in any other way.",
    "The legacy __experimental APIs can‚Äôt be removed on a whim anymore. They became a part of the WordPress public API and fall under the WordPress Backwards Compatibility policy. Removing them involves a deprecation process. It may be relatively easy for some APIs, but it may require effort and span multiple WordPress releases for others.",
    "All in all, don‚Äôt use the __experimental prefix for new APIs. Use plugin-only APIs and private APIs instead.",
    "Plugin-only APIs are temporary values exported from a module whose existence is either pending future revision or provides an immediate means to an end.",
    "To External Consumers:",
    "There is no support commitment for plugin-only APIs. They can and will be removed or changed without advance warning, including as part of a minor or patch release. As an external consumer, you should avoid these APIs.",
    "To Project Contributors:",
    "An plugin-only API is one which is planned for eventual public availability, but is subject to further experimentation, testing, and discussion. It should be made stable or removed at the earliest opportunity.",
    "Plugin-only APIs are excluded from WordPress Core and only available in the Gutenberg Plugin:",
    "The public interface of such APIs is not yet finalized. Aside from references within the code, they APIs should neither be documented nor mentioned in any CHANGELOG. They should effectively be considered to not exist from an external perspective. In most cases, they should only be exposed to satisfy requirements between packages maintained in this repository.",
    "While a plugin-only API may often stabilize into a publicly-available API, there is no guarantee that it will.",
    "Each @wordpress package wanting to privately access or expose a private APIs can\ndo so by opting-in to @wordpress/private-apis:",
    "Each @wordpress package may only opt-in once. The process clearly communicates the extenders are not supposed\nto use it. This document will focus on the usage examples, but you can find out more about the @wordpress/private-apis package in the its README.md.",
    "Once the package opted-in, you can use the lock() and unlock() utilities:",
    "Keep reading to learn how to use lock() and unlock() to avoid publicly exporting\ndifferent kinds of private APIs.",
    "You can attach private selectors and actions to a public store:",
    "Remember to always register the private actions and selectors on the registered store.",
    "Sometimes that‚Äôs easy:",
    "However some package might call both createReduxStore and registerStore. In this case, always choose the store that gets registered:",
    "To add a private argument to a stable function you‚Äôll need\nto prepare a stable and a private version of that function.\nThen, export the stable function and lock() the unstable function\ninside it:",

    "WordPress extenders cannot update the private block settings on their own. The updateSettings() actions of the @wordpress/block-editor store will filter out all the settings that are not a part of the public API. The only way to actually store them is via the private action __experimentalUpdateSettings().",
    "To privatize a block editor setting, add it to the privateSettings list in /packages/block-editor/src/store/actions.js:",
    "As of today, there is no way to restrict the block.json and theme.json APIs\nto the Gutenberg codebase. In the future, however, the new private APIs\nwill only apply to the core WordPress blocks and plugins and themes will not be\nable to access them.",
    "Finally, instead of introducing a new action creator, consider using a thunk:",
    "Some private APIs could benefit from community feedback and it makes sense to expose them to WordPress extenders. At the same time, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to turn them into a public API in WordPress core. What should you do?",
    "You can re-export that private API as a plugin-only API to expose it publicly only in the Gutenberg plugin:",
    "When possible, use shorthand notation when defining object property values:",
    "String literals should be declared with single-quotes unless the string itself contains a single-quote that would need to be escaped‚Äìin that case: use a double-quote. If the string contains a single-quote and a double-quote, you can use ES6 template strings to avoid escaping the quotes.",
    "Note: The single-quote character (') should never be used in place of an apostrophe (‚Äô) for words like it‚Äôs or haven‚Äôt in user-facing strings. For test code it‚Äôs still encouraged to use a real apostrophe.",

    "You should use ES6 Template Strings over string concatenation whenever possible:",
    "Optional chaining is a new language feature introduced in version 2020 of the ECMAScript specification. While the feature can be very convenient for property access on objects which are potentially null-ish (null or undefined), there are a number of common pitfalls to be aware of when using optional chaining. These may be issues that linting and/or type-checking can help protect against at some point in the future. In the meantime, you will want to be cautious of the following items:",
    "It is preferred to implement all components as function components, using hooks to manage component state and lifecycle. With the exception of error boundaries, you should never encounter a situation where you must use a class component. Note that the WordPress guidance on Code Refactoring applies here: There needn‚Äôt be a concentrated effort to update class components in bulk. Instead, consider it as a good refactoring opportunity in combination with some other change.",
    "Gutenberg follows the WordPress JavaScript Documentation Standards, with additional guidelines relevant for its distinct use of import semantics in organizing files, the use of TypeScript tooling for types validation, and automated documentation generation using @wordpress/docgen.",
    "For additional guidance, consult the following resources:",
    "Define custom types using the JSDoc @typedef tag.",
    "A custom type should include a description, and should always include its base type.",
    "Custom types should be named as succinctly as possible, while still retaining clarity of meaning and avoiding conflict with other global or scoped types. A WP prefix should be applied to all custom types. Avoid superfluous or redundant prefixes and suffixes (for example, a Type suffix, or Custom prefix). Custom types are not global by default, so a custom type does not need to be excessively specific to a particular package. However, they should be named with enough specificity to avoid ambiguity or name collisions when brought into the same scope as another type.",
    "Note that there is no {Object} between @typedef and the type name. As @propertys below tells us that it is a type for objects, it is recommend to not use {Object} when you want to define types for your objects.",
    "Custom types can also be used to describe a set of predefined options. While the type union can be used with literal values as an inline type, it can be difficult to align tags while still respecting a maximum line length of 80 characters. Using a custom type to define a union type can afford the opportunity to describe the purpose of these options, and helps to avoid these line length issues.",
    "Note the use of quotes when defining a set of string literals. As in the JavaScript Coding Standards, single quotes should be used when assigning a string literal either as the type or as a default function parameter, or when specifying the path of an imported type.",
    "Use the TypeScript import function to import type declarations from other files or third-party dependencies.",
    "Since an imported type declaration can occupy an excess of the available line length and become verbose when referenced multiple times, you are encouraged to create an alias of the external type using a @typedef declaration at the top of the file, immediately following the import groupings.",
    "Note that all custom types defined in another file can be imported.",
    "When considering which types should be made available from a WordPress package, the @typedef statements in the package‚Äôs entry point script should be treated as effectively the same as its public API. It is important to be aware of this, both to avoid unintentionally exposing internal types on the public interface, and as a way to expose the public types of a project.",
    "In this snippet, the @typedef will support the usage of the previous example‚Äôs import('@wordpress/data').",
    "Many third-party dependencies will distribute their own TypeScript typings. For these, the import semantics should ‚Äújust work‚Äù.",
    "<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1779930/70167742-62198800-1695-11ea-9c21-82a91d4a60e2.png\" alt=\"Working Example: import type‚Äù />",
    "If you use a TypeScript integration for your editor, you can typically see that this works if the type resolves to anything other than the fallback any type.",
    "For packages which do not distribute their own TypeScript types, you are welcomed to install and use the DefinitelyTyped community-maintained types definitions, if one exists.",
    "When documenting a generic type such as Object, Function, Promise, etc., always include details about the expected record types.",
    "When an object is used as a dictionary, you can define its type in 2 ways: indexable interface ({[setting:string]:any}) or Record. When the name of the key for an object provides hints for developers what to do like setting, use indexable interface. If not, use Record.",
    "The function expression here uses TypeScript‚Äôs syntax for function types, which can be useful in providing more detailed information about the names and types of the expected parameters. For more information, consult the TypeScript @type tag function recommendations.",
    "In more advanced cases, you may define your own custom types as a generic type using the TypeScript @template tag.",
    "Similar to the ‚ÄúCustom Types‚Äù advice concerning type unions and with literal values, you can consider to create a custom type @typedef to better describe expected key values for object records, or to extract a complex function signature.",
    "You can express a nullable type using a leading ?. Use the nullable form of a type only if you‚Äôre describing either the type or an explicit null value. Do not use the nullable form as an indicator of an optional parameter.",
    "Similarly, use the undefined type only if you‚Äôre expecting an explicit value of undefined.",
    "If a parameter is optional, use the square-bracket notation. If an optional parameter has a default value which can be expressed as a default parameter in the function expression, it is not necessary to include the value in JSDoc. If the function parameter has an effective default value which requires complex logic and cannot be expressed using the default parameters syntax, you can choose to include the default value in the JSDoc.",
    "When a function does not include a return statement, it is said to have a void return value. It is not necessary to include a @return tag if the return type is void.",
    "If a function has multiple code paths where some (but not all) conditions result in a return statement, you can document this as a union type including the void type.",
    "When documenting a function type, you must always include the void return value type, as otherwise the function is inferred to return a mixed (‚Äúany‚Äù) value, not a void result.",
    "Because the documentation generated using the @wordpress/docgen tool will include @example tags if they are defined, it is considered a best practice to include usage examples for functions and components. This is especially important for documented members of a package‚Äôs public API.",
    "When documenting an example, use the markdown \\`\\`\\` code block to demarcate the beginning and end of the code sample. An example can span multiple lines.",
    "When possible, all components should be implemented as function components, using hooks for managing component lifecycle and state.",
    "Documenting a function component should be treated the same as any other function. The primary caveat in documenting a component is being aware that the function typically accepts only a single argument (the ‚Äúprops‚Äù), which may include many property members. Use the dot syntax for parameter properties to document individual prop types.",
    "For class components, there is no recommendation for documenting the props of the component. Gutenberg does not use or endorse the propTypes static class member.",
    "We use\nphpcs (PHP_CodeSniffer) with the WordPress Coding Standards ruleset to run a lot of automated checks against all PHP code in this project. This ensures that we are consistent with WordPress PHP coding standards.",

    "The workflow for code and documentation is the same, since both are managed in GitHub. You can watch a video walk-through of contributing documentation and the accompanying slides for contributing to Gutenberg.",
    "Here is a visual overview of the Git workflow:",
    "Step 1: Go to the Gutenberg repository on GitHub and click Fork. This creates a copy of the main Gutenberg repository to your account.",
    "Step 2: Clone your forked repository locally. It is located at: `https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/gutenberg`. Cloning copies all the files to your computer. Open a terminal and run:",
    "This will create a directory called gutenberg with all the files for the project. It might take a couple of minutes because it is downloading the entire history of the Gutenberg project.",
    "Step 3: Create a branch for your change (see below for branch naming). For this example, the branch name is the complete string: update/my-branch",
    "Step 4: Make the code changes. Build, confirm, and test your change thoroughly. See coding guidelines and testing overview for guidance.",
    "Step 5: Commit your change with a good commit message. This will commit your change to your local copy of the repository.",
    "Step 6: Push your change up to GitHub. The change will be pushed to your fork of the repository on the GitHub",
    "Step 7: Go to your forked repository on GitHub ‚Äî it will automatically detect the change and give you a link to create a pull request.",
    "Step 8: Create the pull request. This will create the request on the WordPress Gutenberg repository to integrate the change from your forked repository.",
    "Step 9: Keep up with new activity on the pull request. If any additional changes or updates are requested, then make the changes locally and push them up, following Steps 4-6.",
    "Do not make a new pull request for updates; by pushing your change to your repository it will update the same PR. In this sense, the PR is a pointer on the WordPress Gutenberg repository to your copy. So when you update your copy, the PR is also updated.",
    "That‚Äôs it! Once approved and merged, your change will be incorporated into the main repository. üéâ",
    "You should name your branches using a prefixes and short description, like this: [type]/[change].",
    "Suggested prefixes:",
    "For example, add/gallery-block means you‚Äôre working on adding a new gallery block.",
    "When many different people are working on a project simultaneously, pull requests can go stale quickly. A ‚Äústale‚Äù pull request is one that is no longer up to date with the main line of development, and it needs to be updated before it can be merged into the project.",
    "There are two ways to do this: merging and rebasing. In Gutenberg, the recommendation is to rebase. Rebasing means rewriting your changes as if they‚Äôre happening on top of the main line of development. This ensures the commit history is always clean and linear. Rebasing can be performed as many times as needed while you‚Äôre working on a pull request. Do share your work early on by opening a pull request and keeping your history rebase as you progress.",
    "The main line of development is known as the trunk branch. If you have a pull-request branch that cannot be merged into trunk due to a conflict (this can happen for long-running pull requests), then in the course of rebasing you‚Äôll have to manually resolve any conflicts in your local copy. Learn more in section Perform a rebase of How to Rebase a Pull Request.",
    "Once you have resolved any conflicts locally you can update the pull request with git push --force-with-lease. Using the --force-with-lease parameter is important to guarantee that you don‚Äôt accidentally overwrite someone else‚Äôs work.",
    "To sum it up, you need to fetch any new changes in the repository, rebase your branch on top of trunk, and push the result back to the repository. These are the corresponding commands:",
    "Working on pull request starts with forking the Gutenberg repository, your separate working copy. Which can easily go out of sync as new pull requests are merged into the main repository. Here your working repository is a fork and the main Gutenberg repository is upstream. When working on new pull request you should always update your fork before you do git checkout -b my-new-branch to work on a feature or fix.",
    "You will need to add an upstream remote in order to keep your fork updated.",
    "To sync your fork, you first need to fetch the upstream changes and merge them into your local copy:",
    "Once your local copy is updated, push your changes to update your fork on GitHub:",
    "The above commands will update your trunk branch from upstream. To update any other branch replace trunk with the respective branch name.",

Keep this in mind and don‚Äôt store sensitive information in this server.",
    "While it is possible to fix this, you should fix it at your own risk, since it breaks MAMP‚Äôs ability to parse web server configurations and, as a result, makes MAMP think that Apache is listening to the wrong port. Consider switching away from MAMP. Otherwise, you can use the following:",

    "‚ÄúGutenberg‚Äù is the name of the project to create a new editor experience for WordPress ‚Äî contributors have been working on it since January 2017 and it‚Äôs one of the most significant changes to WordPress in years. It‚Äôs built on the idea of using ‚Äúblocks‚Äù to write and design posts and pages. This will serve as the foundation for future improvements to WordPress, including blocks as a way not just to design posts and pages, but also entire sites. The overall goal is to simplify the first-time user experience of WordPress ‚Äî for those who are writing, editing, publishing, and designing web pages. The editing experience is intended to give users a better visual representation of what their post or page will look like when they hit publish. Originally, this was the kickoff goal:",
    "The editor will endeavour to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has ‚Äúblocks‚Äù to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or ‚Äúmystery meat‚Äù embed discovery.",
    "Key takeaways include the following points:",
    "Gutenberg is developed on GitHub under the WordPress organization. The block editor has been available in core WordPress since 5.0. If you want to test upcoming features from Gutenberg project, it is available in the plugin repository.",
    "There are four phases of Gutenberg which you can see on the official WordPress roadmap. As of writing this, we‚Äôre currently in phase 2:",
    "The editor focus started in early 2017 with the first three months spent designing, planning, prototyping, and testing prototypes, to help us inform how to approach this project. The first plugin was launched during WordCamp Europe in June 2017.",
    "Gutenberg was first merged into WordPress 5.0 in December 2018. See the versions in WordPress page for a complete list of Gutenberg plugin versions merged into WordPress core releases.",
    "The Editor is where most of the action happens in WordPress‚Äôs daily use, and it was a place where we could polish and perfect the block experience in a contained environment. Further, as an open-source project, we believe that it is critical for WordPress to continue to innovate and keep working to make the core experience intuitive and enjoyable for all users. As a community project, Gutenberg has the potential to do just that, and we‚Äôre excited to pursue this goal together. If you‚Äôd like to test, contribute, or offer feedback, we welcome you to share what you find on GitHub.",
    "The classic WordPress editor is an open text window‚Äîit‚Äôs always been a wonderful blank canvas for writing, but when it comes to building posts and pages with images, multimedia, embedded content from social media, polls, and other elements, it required a mix of different approaches that were not always intuitive:",
    "As we thought about these uses and how to make them obvious and consistent, we began to embrace the concept of ‚Äúblocks.‚Äù All of the above items could be blocks: easy to search and understand, and easy to dynamically shift around the page. The block concept is very powerful, and when designed thoughtfully, can offer an outstanding editing and publishing experience. Ultimately, the idea with blocks is to create a new common language across WordPress, a new way to connect users to plugins, and replace a number of older content types ‚Äî things like shortcodes and widgets ‚Äî that one usually has to be well-versed in the idiosyncrasies of WordPress to understand.",
    "Our goal with Gutenberg is not just to create a seamless post- and page-building experience. We also want to ensure that it provides a seamless writing experience. To test this out yourself, head to this demo and give it a try!",
    "No. TinyMCE is only used for the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù block.",
    "Yes. There are a lot! There is a help modal showing all available keyboard shortcuts.",
    "You can see the whole list going to the top right corner menu of the new editor and clicking on ‚ÄúKeyboard Shortcuts‚Äù (or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Alt+H on Linux/Windows and ‚åÉ‚å•H on macOS).",
    "This is the canonical list of keyboard shortcuts:",
    "Here is a brief animation illustrating how to find and use the keyboard shortcuts:",
    "Yes, a columns block is available in Gutenberg.",
    "Yes, it is supported. You can have multiple levels of nesting ‚Äì blocks within blocks within blocks. See the Nested Block Tutorial for more information.",
    "Yes, you can drag and drop blocks to rearrange their order.",
    "The best place to start is the Create a Block Tutorial.",
    "No, we are designing Gutenberg primarily as a replacement for the post and page editing screens. That said, front-end editing is often confused with an editor that looks exactly like the front end. And that is something that Gutenberg will allow as themes customize individual blocks and provide those styles to the editor. Since content is designed to be distributed across so many different experiences‚Äîfrom desktop and mobile to full-text feeds and syndicated article platforms‚Äîwe believe it‚Äôs not ideal to create or design posts from just one front-end experience.",
    "See the Meta Box Tutorial for more information on using Meta boxes with the new block editor.",
    "The main extension point we want to emphasize is creating new blocks. Blocks are added to the block editor using plugins, see the Create a Block Tutorial to get started.",
    "Indeed. There are multiple ways in which custom post types can leverage Gutenberg. The plan is to allow them to specify the blocks they support, as well as defining a default block for the post type. It‚Äôs not currently the case, but if a post type disables the content field, the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù section at the bottom would fill the page.",
    "Yes. Blocks can provide their own styles, which themes can add to or override, or they can provide no styles at all and rely fully on what the theme provides.",
    "Blocks are able to provide base structural CSS styles, and themes can add styles on top of this. Some blocks, like a Separator (<hr/>), likely don‚Äôt need any front-end styles, while others, like a Gallery, need a few.",
    "Other features, like the new wide and full-wide alignment options, are simply CSS classes applied to blocks that offer this alignment. We are looking at how a theme can opt in to this feature, for example using add_theme_support.",
    "This is currently a work in progress and we recommend reviewing the block based theme documentation to learn more.",
    "No, block variations are different versions of a single base block, sharing a similar functionality, but with slight differences in their implementation, or settings (attributes, InnerBlocks,etc). Block variations are transparent for users, and once there is a registered block variation, it will appear as a new block. For example, the embed block registers different block variations to embed content from specific providers.",
    "Meanwhile, block styles allow you to provide alternative styles to existing blocks, and they work by adding a className to the block‚Äôs wrapper. Once a block has registered block styles, a block style selector will appear in its sidebar so that users can choose among the different registered styles.",
    "Regular editor styles are opt-in and work as is in most cases. Themes can also load extra stylesheets by using the following hook:",
    "See: Editor Styles",
    "Gutenberg works in modern browsers.",
    "The list of supported browsers can be found in the Make WordPress handbook. The term ‚Äúmodern browsers‚Äù generally refers to the current and previous two versions of each major browser.",
    "Since WordPress 5.8, Gutenberg no longer supports any version of Internet Explorer.",
    "The goal of Gutenberg is not to put anyone out of business. It‚Äôs to evolve WordPress so there‚Äôs more business to be had in the future, for everyone.",
    "Aside from enabling a rich post and page building experience, a meta goal is to move WordPress forward as a platform. Not only by modernizing the UI, but by modernizing the foundation.",
    "We realize it‚Äôs a big change. We also think there will be many new opportunities for plugins. WordPress is likely to ship with a range of basic blocks, but there will be plenty of room for highly tailored premium plugins to augment existing blocks or add new blocks to the mix.",
    "There is a ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù block, which is virtually the same as the current editor, except in block form.",
    "There is also the Classic Editor plugin which restores the previous editor, see the plugin for more information. The WordPress Core team has committed to supporting the Classic Editor plugin until December 2021.",
    "Custom TinyMCE buttons still work in the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù block, which is a block version of the classic editor you know today.",
    "Gutenberg comes with a new universal inserter tool, which gives you access to every block available, searchable, sorted by recency and categories. This inserter tool levels the playing field for every plugin that adds content to the editor, and provides a single interface to learn how to use.",
    "Shortcodes continue to work as they do now.",
    "However we see the block as an evolution of the [shortcode]. Instead of having to type out code, you can use the universal inserter tray to pick a block and get a richer interface for both configuring the block and previewing it. We would recommend people eventually upgrade their shortcodes to be blocks.",
    "We think so for a variety of reasons including but not limited to:",
    "Ultimately, Blocks are designed to be visually representative of the final look, and, with the launch of the Block Directory in 5.5, they will become the expected way in which users will discover and insert content in WordPress.",
    "Accessibility is not an afterthought. Not every aspect of Gutenberg is accessible at the moment. You can check logged issues here. We understand that WordPress is for everyone, and that accessibility is about inclusion. This is a key value for us.",
    "If you would like to contribute to the accessibility of Gutenberg, we can always use more people to test and contribute.",
    "Our approach‚Äîas outlined in the technical overview introduction‚Äîis to augment the existing data format in a way that doesn‚Äôt break the decade-and-a-half-fabric of content WordPress provides. In other terms, this optimizes for a format that prioritizes human readability (the HTML document of the web) and easy-to-render-anywhere over a machine convenient file (JSON in post-meta) that benefits the editing context primarily.",
    "This also gives us the flexibility to store those blocks that are inherently separate from the content stream (reusable pieces like widgets or small post type elements) elsewhere, and just keep token references for their placement.",

This should be thought of as the primary interface for adding and manipulating content and adjusting how it is displayed. There are two ways of interacting here:",
    "Basic block settings won‚Äôt always make sense in the context of the placeholder/content UI. As a secondary option, options that are critical to the functionality of a block can live in the block toolbar. The Block Toolbar is still highly contextual and visible on all screen sizes. One notable constraint with the Block Toolbar is that it is icon-based UI, so any controls that live in the Block Toolbar need to be ones that can effectively be communicated via an icon or icon group.",
    "The Block Toolbar groups controls in segments, hierarchically. The first segment contains block type controls, such as the block switcher, the drag handle, and the mover control. The second group contains common and specific block tools that affect the entire block, followed by inline formatting, and the ‚ÄúMore‚Äù menu. Optionally ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù or ‚ÄúOther‚Äù groups can separate some tools in their own segment.",
    "The Settings Sidebar is not visible by default on a small / mobile screen, and may also be collapsed in a desktop view. Therefore, it should not be relied on for anything that is necessary for the basic operation of the block.

    "In most cases, a block‚Äôs setup state is only shown once and then further customization is done via the live preview state. However, in some cases it might be desirable to allow the user to return to the setup state ‚Äî for example, if all the block content has been deleted or via a link from the block‚Äôs toolbar or sidebar.",
    "Group toolbar controls in logical segments. Don‚Äôt add a segment for each.",
    "A block should have a straightforward, short name so users can easily find it in the block library. A block named ‚ÄúYouTube‚Äù is easy to find and understand. The same block, named ‚ÄúEmbedded Video (YouTube)‚Äù, would be less clear and harder to find in the block library.",
    "When referring to a block in documentation or UI, use title case for the block title and lowercase for the ‚Äúblock‚Äù descriptor. For example:",

    "The final HTML document is the result of a few things:",
    "The stylesheets loaded in the front end include:",
    "Since the introduction of the block editor in WordPress 5.0, there were tools for the users to ‚Äúadd styles‚Äù to specific blocks. By using these tools, the user would attach new classes or inline styles to the blocks, modifying their visual aspect.",
    "By default, blocks come with a given HTML markup. Think of the paragraph block, for example:",
    "In its simplest form, any style rule that targets the p selector will apply styles to this block, whether it comes from a block, a theme, etc.",
    "The user may change the state of this block by applying different styles: a text alignment, a color, a font size, a line height, etc. These states are reflected in the HTML markup of the block in the form of HTML attributes, mainly through the class or style attributes, though it can be any other the block author sees fit.",
    "After some user modifications to the block, the initial markup may become something like this:",
    "This is what we refer to as ‚Äúuser-provided block styles‚Äù, also know as ‚Äúlocal styles‚Äù or ‚Äúserialized styles‚Äù. Essentially, each tool (font size, color, etc) ends up adding some classes and/or inline styles to the block markup. The CSS styling for these classes is part of the block, global, or theme stylesheets.",
    "The ability to modify a block state coupled with the fact that a block can live within any other block (think of a paragraph within a group), creates a vast amount of potential states and style possibilities.",
    "If you follow the block tutorial you can learn up about the different parts of the block API presented here in more detail and also build your own block. This is an introduction to the general concepts of how a block can let users edit its state.",
    "To build an experience like the one described above a block author needs a few pieces:",
    "In essence, these are the essential mechanics a block author needs to care about for their block to be able to be styled by the user. While this can be done completely manually, there‚Äôs an API that automates this process for common style needs: block supports.",
    "Block Supports is an API that allows a block to declare what features it supports. By adding some info to their block.json file, the block tells the system what kind of actions a user can do to it.",
    "The paragraph declares support for font size in its block.json. This means the block will show a UI control for users to tweak its font size, unless it‚Äôs disabled by the theme (learn more about how themes can disable UI controls in the theme.json reference). The system will also take care of setting up the UI control data (the font size of the block if it has one already assigned, the list of available font sizes to show), and will serialize the block data into HTML markup upon user changes (attach classes and inline styles appropriately).",
    "By using the block supports mechanism via block.json, the block author is able to create the same experience as before just by writing a couple of lines. Check the tutorials for adding block supports to static and dynamic blocks.",
    "Besides the benefit of having to do less work to achieve the same results, there‚Äôs a few other advantages:",
    "While the Block Supports API provides value, it also comes with some limitations a block author needs to be aware of. To better visualize what they are, let‚Äôs run with the following example of a table block:",
    "One of the limitations is that, from all the styles available, there can be only one instance of any them in use by the block. Following the example, the table block can only have a single font size. If the block author wanted to have three different font sizes (head, body, and footer) it can‚Äôt do it using the current block supports API. See this issue for more detailed info and ways forward.",
    "The block supports API only serializes the font size value to the wrapper, resulting in the following HTML <table class=\"has-small-font-size\"> . The current block supports API doesn‚Äôt serialize this value to a different node, for example, the <tbody>.",
    "This is an active area of work you can follow in the tracking issue. The linked proposal is exploring a different way to serialize the user changes: instead of each block support serializing its own data (for example, classes such as has-small-font-size, has-green-color) the idea is the block would get a single class instead (for example, wp-style-UUID) and the CSS styling for that class will be generated in the server by WordPress.",
    "While work continues in that proposal, there‚Äôs an escape hatch, an experimental option block authors can use. Any block support can skip the serialization to HTML markup by using __experimentalSkipSerialization. For example:",
    "This means that the typography block support will do all of the things (create a UI control, bind the block attribute to the control, etc) except serializing the user values into the HTML markup. The classes and inline styles will not be automatically applied to the wrapper and it is the block author‚Äôs responsibility to implement this in the edit, save, and render_callback functions. See this issue for examples of how it was done for some blocks provided by WordPress.",
    "Note that, if __experimentalSkipSerialization is enabled for a group (typography, color, spacing) it affects all block supports within this group. In the example above all the properties within the typography group will be affected (e.g. fontSize, lineHeight, fontFamily .etc).",
    "To enable for a single property only, you may use an array to declare which properties are to be skipped. In the example below, only fontSize will skip serialization, leaving other items within the typography group (e.g. lineHeight, fontFamily .etc) unaffected.",
    "Support for this feature was added in this PR.",
    "Global Styles refers to a mechanism that generates site-wide styles. Unlike the block styles described in the previous section, these are not serialized into the post content and are not attached to the block HTML. Instead, the output of this system is a new stylesheet with id global-styles-inline-css.",
    "This mechanism was introduced in WordPress 5.8. At the time, it only took data from WordPress and the active theme. WordPress 5.9 expanded the system to also take style data from users.",
    "This is the general data flow:",
    "The process of generating the stylesheet has, in essence, three steps:",
    "The data can come from three different origins: WordPress defaults, the active theme, or the user. All three of them use the same theme.json format.",
    "Data from WordPress and the active theme is retrieved from the corresponding theme.json file. Data from the user is pulled from the database, where it‚Äôs stored after the user saves the changes they did via the global styles sidebar in the site editor.",
    "The goal of this phase is to build a consolidated structure.",
    "There are two important processes going on in this phase. First, the system needs to normalize all the incoming data, as different origins may be using different versions of the theme.json format. For example, a theme may be using v1 while the WordPress base is using the latest version. Second, the system needs to decide how to merge the input into a single structure. This will be the focus of the following sections.",
    "Different parts of the incoming theme.json structure are treated differently. The data present in the styles section is blended together following this logic: user data overrides theme data, and theme data overrides WordPress data.",
    "For example, if we had the following three theme.json structures coming from WordPress, the theme, and the user respectively:",
    "The result after the consolidation would be:",
    "The settings section works differently than styles. Most of the settings are only used to configure the editor and have no effect on the global styles. Only a few of them are part of the resulting stylesheet: the presets.",
    "Presets are the predefined styles that are shown to the user in different parts of the UI: the color palette or the font sizes, for example. They comprise the following settings: color.duotone, color.gradients, color.palette, typography.fontFamilies, typography.fontSizes. Unlike styles, presets from an origin don‚Äôt override values from other origins. Instead, all of them are stored in the consolidated structure.",
    "For example, if we have the following theme.json structures coming from WordPress, the theme, and the user respectively:",
    "The last phase of generating the stylesheet is converting the consolidated data into CSS style rules.",
    "The styles section can be thought of as a structured representation of CSS rules, each chunk representing a CSS rule:",
    "For example, the following theme.json structure:",
    "is converted to the following CSS:",
    "From the settings section, all the values of any given presets will be converted to a CSS Custom Property that follows this naming structure: --wp--preset--<category>-<slug>. The selectors follow the same rules described in the styles section above.",
    "For example, the following theme.json",
    "Will be converted to the following CSS style rule:",
    "In addition to the CSS Custom Properties, all presets but duotone generate CSS classes for each value. The example above will generate the following CSS classes as well:",
    "By default, the selector assigned to a block is .wp-block-<block-name>. However, blocks can change this should they need. They can provide a CSS selector via the __experimentalSelector property in its block.json.",
    "If blocks do this, they need to be registered in the server using the block.json, otherwise, the global styles code doesn‚Äôt have access to that information and will use the default CSS selector for the block.",
    "Every chunk of styles can only use a single selector.",
    "This is particularly relevant if the block is using __experimentalSkipSerialization to serialize the different style properties to different nodes other than the wrapper. See ‚ÄúCurrent limitations of blocks supports‚Äù for more.",
    "Similarly to block supports, there can be only one instance of any style in use by the block. For example, the block can only have a single font size. See related ‚ÄúCurrent limitations of block supports‚Äù.",
    "The global styles UI in the site editor has a screen for per-block styles. The list of blocks is generated dynamically using the block supports from the block.json of blocks. If a block wants to be listed there, it needs to use the block supports mechanism.",
    "In addition to styles at the individual block level and in global styles, there is the concept of layout styles that are output for both blocks-based and classic themes.",
    "The layout block support is an experimental approach for outputting common layout styles that are shared between blocks that are used for creating layouts. Layout styles are useful for providing common styling for any block that is a container for other blocks. Examples of blocks that depend on these layout styles include Group, Row, Columns, Buttons, and Social Icons.",
    "While the feature is part of WordPress core, it is still flagged as experimental in the sense that the features and output are still undergoing active development. It is therefore not yet a stable feature from the perspective of 3rd party blocks, as the API is likely to change. The feature is enabled in core blocks via the __experimentalLayout setting under supports in a block‚Äôs block.json file.",
    "There are two primary places where Layout styles are output:",
    "Base layout styles are those styles that are common to all blocks that opt in to a particular layout type. Examples of common base layout styling include setting display: flex for blocks that use the Flex layout type (such as Buttons and Social Icons), and providing default max-width for constrained layouts.",
    "Base layout styles are output from within the main PHP class that handles global styles, and form part of the global styles stylesheet. In order to provide support for core blocks in classic themes, these styles are always output, irrespective of whether the theme provides its own theme.json file.",
    "Common layout definitions are stored in the core theme.json file, but are not intended to be extended or overridden by themes.",
    "When a block that opts in to the experimental layout support is rendered, two things are processed and added to the output via layout.php:",
    "There are currently three layout types in use:",
    "For controlling spacing between blocks, and enabling block spacing controls see: What is blockGap and how can I use it?.",
    "The layout block support is designed to enable control over layout features from within the block and site editors. Where possible, try to use the features of the blocks to determine particular layout requirements rather than relying upon additional stylesheets.",
    "For themes that wish to target container blocks in order to add or adjust particular styles, the block‚Äôs class name is often the best class name to use. Class names such as wp-block-group or wp-block-columns are usually reliable class names for targeting a particular block.",
    "For targeting a block that uses a particular layout type, avoid targeting wp-container- as container classes may not always be present in the rendered markup.",
    "Work is currently underway to expand stable semantic classnames in Layout block support output. The task is being discussed in this issue.",
    "The current semantic class names that can be output by the Layout block support are:",
    "Layout styles output is switched on by default because the styles are required by core structural blocks. However, themes can opt out of generated block layout styles while retaining semantic class name output by using the disable-layout-styles block support. Such themes will be responsible for providing all their own layout styles. See the entry under Theme Support.",
    "This document will explain the internals of how templates and templates parts are rendered in the frontend and edited in the backend. For an introduction about block themes and Full site editing templates, refer to the block theme documentation.",
    "Just like the regular templates, the block templates live initially as files in the theme folder but the main difference is that the user can edit these templates in the UI in the Site Editor.",
    "When a user edits a template (or template-part), the initial theme template file is kept as is but a forked version of the template is saved to the wp_template custom post type (or wp_template_part for template parts).",
    "These capabilities mean that at any point in time, a mix of template files (from the theme) and CPT templates (the edited templates) are used to render the frontend of the site.",
    "In order to simplify the algorithm used to edit and render the templates from two different places, we performed an operation called ‚Äútemplate synchronization‚Äù.",
    "The synchronization consists of duplicating the theme templates in the wp_template (and wp_template_part) custom templates with an auto-draft status. When a user edits these templates, the status is updated to publish.",
    "This means:",
    "The synchronization is important for two different flows:",
    "Since block themes make use of templates that can refer to each other and that can be saved to a custom post type, it becomes possible to mix templates and template parts from different themes. For example:",
    "Enabling these flows will require well thought UIs and experience. For the current phase of Full-site editing, we‚Äôre starting by forbidding these possibilities and making template and template-parts theme specific.",
    "That said, it is still important to keep track of where the template and template part come from initially. From which theme, it‚Äôs based. We do so by saving a theme post meta containing the theme identifier for each template and template part CPT entry.",
    "In the future, we might consider allowing the user to mix template and template parts with different theme post meta values.",
    "There exists a rich ecosystem of tooling available for web-based end-to-end automated testing. Thus, it‚Äôs a common question: ‚ÄúWhy does Gutenberg use Puppeteer instead of (Cypress, Selenium, Playwright, etc)?‚Äù. Given some historical unreliability of the build results associated with end-to-end tests, it‚Äôs especially natural to weigh this question in considering whether our tools are providing more value than the effort required in maintaining them. While we should always be comfortable in reevaluating earlier decisions, there were and continue to be many reasons that Puppeteer is the best compromise of the options available for end-to-end testing.",

    "Performance is a key feature for editor applications and the Block editor is not an exception.",
    "To ensure the block editor stays performant across releases and development, we monitor some key metrics using performance benchmark job.",
    "Loading Time: The time it takes to load an editor page. This includes time the server takes to respond, times to first paint, first contentful paint, DOM content load complete, load complete and first block render.\nTyping Time: The time it takes for the browser to respond while typing on the editor.\nBlock Selection Time: The time it takes for the browser to respond after a user selects block. (Inserting a block is also equivalent to selecting a block. Monitoring the selection is sufficient to cover both metrics).",
    "Data Module Async Mode",
    "The Data Module of the WordPress Packages and the Block Editor is based on Redux. It means the state is kept globally and whenever a change happens, the components (UI) relying on that state may update.",
    "As the number of rendered components grows (for example on long posts), the performance suffers because of the global state acting as an event dispatcher to all components. This is a common pitfall in Redux applications and the issue is solved on Gutenberg using the Data Modules Async Mode.",
    "The Async mode is the idea that you can decide whether to refresh/rerender a part of the React component tree synchronously or asynchronously.",
    "Rendering asynchronously in this context means that if a change is triggered in the global state, the subscribers (components) are not called synchronously, instead, we wait for the browser to be idle and perform the updates to React Tree.",
    "Based on the idea that when editing a given block, it is very rare that an update to that block affects other parts of the content, the block editor canvas only renders the selected block is synchronous mode, all the remaining blocks are rendered asynchronously. This ensures that the editor stays responsive as the post grows.",
    "A tool to compare performance across multiple branches/tags/commits is provided. You can run it locally like so: ./bin/plugin/cli.js perf [branches], example:",
    "To get the most accurate results, it‚Äôs is important to use the exact same version of the tests and environment (theme‚Ä¶) when running the tests, the only thing that need to be different between the branches is the Gutenberg plugin version (or branch used to build the plugin).",
    "To achieve that the command first prepares the following folder structure:",
    "Once the directory above is in place, the performance command loop over the performance test suites (post editor and site editor) and does the following:",
    "1- Start the environment for branch1\n 2- Run the performance test for the current suite\n 3- Stop the environment for branch1\n 4- Repeat the first 3 steps for all other branches\n 5- Repeat the previous 4 steps 3 times.\n 6- Compute medians for all the performance metrics of the current suite.",
    "Once all the test suites are executed, a summary report is printed.",
    "The WordPress block editor is based around the idea that you can combine independent blocks together to write your post or build your page. Blocks can also use and interact with each other. This makes it very modular and flexible.",
    "But the Block Editor does not embrace modularity for its behavior and output only. The Gutenberg repository is also built from the ground up as several reusable and independent modules or packages, that, combined together, lead to the application and interface we all know. These modules are known as WordPress packages and are published and updated regularly on the npm package repository.",
    "These packages are used to power the Block Editor, but they can be used to power any page in the WordPress Admin or outside.",
    "Using a modular architecture has several benefits for all the actors involved:",
    "Almost everything in the Gutenberg repository is built into a package. We can split these packages into two different types:",
    "These are the packages that ship in WordPress itself as JavaScript scripts. These constitute the actual production code that runs on your browsers. As an example, there‚Äôs a components package serving as a reusable set of React components used to prototype and build interfaces quickly. There‚Äôs also an api-fetch package that can be used to call WordPress Rest APIs.",
    "Third-party developers can use these production packages in two different ways:",
    "Script dependencies definition can be a tedious task for developers. Mistakes and oversight can happen easily. If you want to learn how you can automate this task. Check the @wordpress/scripts and @wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin documentation.",
    "Some production packages provide stylesheets to function properly.",
    "In the context of existing WordPress pages, if you omit to define the scripts or styles dependencies properly, your plugin might still work properly if these scripts and styles are already loaded there by WordPress or by other plugins, but it‚Äôs highly recommended to define all your dependencies exhaustively if you want to avoid potential breakage in future versions.",
    "Some WordPress production packages define data stores to handle their state. These stores can also be used by third-party plugins and themes to retrieve data and to manipulate it. The name of these data stores is also normalized following this format core/package-name (E.g. the @wordpress/block-editor package defines and uses the core/block-editor data store).",
    "If you‚Äôre using one of these stores to access and manipulate WordPress data in your plugins, don‚Äôt forget to add the corresponding WordPress script to your own script dependencies for your plugin to work properly. (For instance, if you‚Äôre retrieving data from the core/block-editor store, you should add the wp-block-editor package to your script dependencies like shown above).",
    "These are packages used in development mode to help developers with daily tasks to develop, build and ship JavaScript applications, WordPress plugins and themes. They include tools for linting your codebase, building it, testing it‚Ä¶",
    "It‚Äôs often surprising to new contributors to discover that the post editor is constructed as a layered abstraction of three separate packages @wordpress/edit-post, @wordpress/editor, and @wordpress/block-editor.",

    "A block editor post is the proper block-aware representation of a post: a collection of semantically consistent descriptions of what each block is and what its essential data is. This representation only ever exists in memory. It is the chase in the typesetter‚Äôs workshop, ever-shifting as sorts are attached and repositioned.",
    "A block editor post is not the artifact it produces, namely the post_content. The latter is the printed page, optimized for the reader but retaining its invisible markings for later editing.",
    "The input and output of the block editor is a tree of block objects with the current format:",
    "Each block object has an id, a set of attributes and potentially a list of child blocks.",
    "Note the attributes keys and types, the allowed inner blocks are defined by the block type. For example, the core quote block has a cite string attribute representing the cite content while a heading block has a numeric level attribute, representing the level of the heading (1 to 6).",
    "During the lifecycle of the block in the editor, the block object can receive extra metadata:",
    "Examples",
    "This data model, however, is something that lives in memory while editing a post. It‚Äôs not visible to the page viewer when rendered, just like a printed page has no trace of the structure of the letters that produced it in the press.",
    "Since the whole WordPress ecosystem has an expectation for receiving HTML when rendering or editing a post, the block editor transforms its data into something that can be saved in post_content through serialization. This assures that there‚Äôs a single source of truth for the content, and that this source remains readable and compatible with all the tools that interact with WordPress content at the present. Were we to store the object tree separately, we would face the risk of post_content and the tree getting out of sync and the problem of data duplication in both places.",
    "Thus, the serialization process converts the block tree into HTML using HTML comments as explicit block delimiters‚Äîwhich can contain the attributes in non-HTML form. This is the act of printing invisible marks on the printed page that leave a trace of the original structured intention.",
    "This is one end of the process. The other is how to recreate the collection of blocks whenever a post is to be edited again. A formal grammar defines how the serialized representation of a block editor post should be loaded, just as some basic rules define how to turn the tree into an HTML-like string. The block editor‚Äôs posts aren‚Äôt designed to be edited by hand; they aren‚Äôt designed to be edited as HTML documents because the block editor posts aren‚Äôt HTML in essence.",
    "They just happen, incidentally, to be stored inside of post_content in a way in which they require no transformation in order to be viewable by any legacy system. It‚Äôs true that loading the stored HTML into a browser without the corresponding machinery might degrade the experience, and if it included dynamic blocks of content, the dynamic elements may not load, server-generated content may not appear, and interactive content may remain static. However, it at least protects against not being able to view block editor posts on themes and installations that are blocks-unaware, and it provides the most accessible way to the content. In other words, the post remains mostly intact even if the saved HTML is rendered as is.",
    "We chose instead to try to find a way to keep the formality, explicitness, and unambiguity in the existing HTML syntax. Within the HTML there were a number of options.",
    "Of these options, a novel approach was suggested: by storing data in HTML comments, we would know that we wouldn‚Äôt break the rest of the HTML in the document, that browsers should ignore it, and that we could simplify our approach to parsing the document.",
    "Unique to HTML comments is the fact that they cannot legitimately exist in ambiguous places, such as inside of HTML attributes like <img alt='data-id=\"14\"'>. Comments are also quite permissive. Whereas HTML attributes are complicated to parse properly, comments are quite easily described by a leading <!-- followed by anything except -- until the first -->. This simplicity and permissiveness means that the parser can be implemented in several ways without needing to understand HTML properly, and we have the liberty to use more convenient syntax inside of the comment‚Äîwe only need to escape double-hyphen sequences. We take advantage of this in how we store block attributes: as JSON literals inside the comment.",
    "After running this through the parser, we‚Äôre left with a simple object we can manipulate idiomatically, and we don‚Äôt have to worry about escaping or unescaping the data. It‚Äôs handled for us through the serialization process. Because the comments are so different from other HTML tags and because we can perform a first-pass to extract the top-level blocks, we don‚Äôt actually depend on having fully valid HTML!",
    "This has dramatic implications for how simple and performant we can make our parser. These explicit boundaries also protect damage in a single block from bleeding into other blocks or tarnishing the entire document. It also allows the system to identify unrecognized blocks before rendering them.",
    "N.B.: The defining aspects of blocks are their semantics and the isolation mechanism they provide: in other words, their identity. On the other hand, where their data is stored is a more liberal aspect. Blocks support more than just static local data (via JSON literals inside the HTML comment or within the block‚Äôs HTML), and more mechanisms (e.g., global blocks or otherwise resorting to storage in complementary WP_Post objects) are expected. See attributes for details.",
    "When blocks are saved to the content after the editing session, its attributes‚Äîdepending on the nature of the block‚Äîare serialized to these explicit comment delimiters.",
    "A purely dynamic block that is to be server-rendered before display could look like this:",
    "In summary, the block editor workflow parses the saved document to an in-memory tree of blocks, using token delimiters to help. During editing, all manipulations happen within the block tree. The process ends by serializing the blocks back to the post_content.",

Unlike reusable blocks, once a pattern is inserted it doesn‚Äôt remain in sync with the original content as the blocks contained are meant to be edited and customized by the user.

    "Using the ALLOWED_BLOCKS property, you can define the set of blocks allowed in your InnerBlock. This restricts the blocks that can be included only to those listed, all other blocks will not show in the inserter.",
    "By default, InnerBlocks expects its blocks to be shown in a vertical list. A valid use-case is to style inner blocks to appear horizontally, for instance by adding CSS flex or grid properties to the inner blocks wrapper. When blocks are styled in such a way, the orientation prop can be set to indicate that a horizontal layout is being used:",
    "Specifying this prop does not affect the layout of the inner blocks, but results in the block mover icons in the child blocks being displayed horizontally, and also ensures that drag and drop works correctly.",
    "Use the template property to define a set of blocks that prefill the InnerBlocks component when inserted. You can set attributes on the blocks to define their use. The example below shows a book review template using InnerBlocks component and setting placeholders values to show the block usage.",
    "Use the templateLock property to lock down the template. Using all locks the template completely so no changes can be made. Using insert prevents additional blocks from being inserted, but existing blocks can be reordered. See templateLock documentation for additional information.",
    "Unrelated to InnerBlocks but worth mentioning here, you can create a post template by post type, that preloads the block editor with a set of blocks.",
    "The InnerBlocks template is for the component in the single block that you created, the rest of the post can include any blocks the user likes. Using a post template, can lock the entire post to just the template you define.",
    "A common pattern for using InnerBlocks is to create a custom block that will be included only in the InnerBlocks.",
    "An example of this is the Columns block, that creates a single parent block called columns and then creates an child block called column. The parent block is defined to only allow the child blocks. See Column code for reference.",
    "When defining a child block, use the parent block setting to define which block is the parent. This prevents the block showing in the inserter outside of the InnerBlock it is defined for.",
    "Another example is using the ancestors block setting to define a block that must be present as an ancestor, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be the direct parent (like with parent). This prevents the block from showing in the inserter if the ancestor is not in the tree, but other blocks can be added in between, like a Columns or Group block. See Comment Author Name code for reference.",
    "You can use a react hook called useInnerBlocksProps instead of the InnerBlocks component. This hook allows you to take more control over the markup of inner blocks areas.",
    "The useInnerBlocksProps is exported from the @wordpress/block-editor package same as the InnerBlocks component itself and supports everything the component does. It also works like the useBlockProps hook.",
    "Here is the basic useInnerBlocksProps hook usage.",
    "This hook can also pass objects returned from the useBlockProps hook to the useInnerBlocksProps hook. This reduces the number of elements we need to create.",
    "The above code will render to the following markup in the editor:",
    "Another benefit to using the hook approach is using the returned value, which is just an object, and deconstruct to get the react children from the object. This property contains the actual child inner blocks thus we can place elements on the same level as our inner blocks.",

However, we don‚Äôt begin in WordPress with a representation of the state of the post that is conductive to this expression nor one that even has any knowledge of blocks because content is stored in a serialized way in a single field.",
    "Such a crucial step is handled by the grammar parsing which takes the serialized content of the post and infers an ordered block list using, preferably, syntax hints present in HTML comments. The editor is initialized with a state representation of the block nodes generated by the parsing of the raw content of a post element: wp.blocks.parse( post.content.raw ).",

This removes any trace of imperative handling when it comes to finding a block and manipulating a block. As a matter of fact, the visual editor or the text editor are just two different‚Äîequally valid‚Äîviews of the same representation of state. The internal representation of the post content is updated as blocks are updated and it is serialized back to be saved in post_content.",

It minimizes data copying and passing through the use of globals for tracking state through the parse. Between every token (a block comment delimiter) we can instrument the parser and intervene should we want to; for example we might put a hard limit on how long we can be parsing a document or provide additional debugging diagnostics for a document.",
    "The spec parser is defined via a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) which answers many questions inherently that we must answer explicitly in this parser. The goal for this implementation is to match the characteristics of the PEG so that it can be directly swapped out and so that the only changes are better runtime performance and memory usage.",
    "Every serialized Gutenberg document is nominally an HTML document which, in addition to normal HTML, may also contain specially designed HTML comments ‚Äî the block comment delimiters ‚Äî which separate and isolate the blocks serialized in the document.",
    "This parser attempts to create a state-machine around the transitions triggered from those delimiters ‚Äî the ‚Äútokens‚Äù of the grammar. Every time we find one we should only be doing either of:",
    "Those actions have different effects depending on the context; for instance, when we exit a block we either need to add it to the output block list or we need to append it as the next innerBlock on the parent block below it in the block stack (the place where we track open blocks). The details are documented below.",
    "The biggest challenge in this parser is making the right accounting of indices required to construct the innerHTML values for each block at every level of nesting depth. We take a simple approach:",
    "This parser operates much faster than the generated parser from the specification. Because we know more about the parsing than the PEG does we can take advantage of several tricks to improve our speed and memory usage:",
    "Further, tokenizing with a RegExp brings an additional advantage. The parser generated by the PEG provides predictable performance characteristics in exchange for control over tokenization rules ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt allow us to define RegExp patterns in the rules so as to guard against e.g. cataclysmic backtracking that would break the PEG guarantees.",
    "However, since our ‚Äútoken language‚Äù of the block comment delimiters is regular and can be trivially matched with RegExp patterns, we can do that here and then something magical happens: we jump out of PHP or JavaScript and into a highly-optimized RegExp engine written in C or C++ on the host system. We thereby leave the virtual machine and its overhead.",

    "WordPress 5.8 comes with a new mechanism to configure the editor that enables a finer-grained control and introduces the first step in managing styles for future WordPress releases: the theme.json file. Then theme.json evolved to a v2 with WordPress 5.9 release. This page documents its format.",
    "The Block Editor API has evolved at different velocities and there are some growing pains, specially in areas that affect themes. Examples of this are: the ability to control the editor programmatically, or a block style system that facilitates user, theme, and core style preferences.",

    "For more granularity, these settings also work at the block level in theme.json.",
    "Examples of what can be achieved are:",
    "By using the theme.json file to set style properties in a structured way, the Block Editor can ‚Äúmanage‚Äù the CSS that comes from different origins (user, theme, and core CSS). For example, if a theme and a user set the font size for paragraphs, we only enqueue the style coming from the user and not the theme‚Äôs.",
    "Some of the advantages are:",
    "There are some areas of styling that would benefit from having shared values that can change across a site.",
    "To address this need, we‚Äôve started to experiment with CSS Custom Properties, aka CSS Variables, in some places:",

Users, via the site editor, will also be able to override theme‚Äôs or core‚Äôs preferences via an user interface that is being worked on.",

    "Each block can configure any of these settings separately, providing a more fine-grained control over what exists via add_theme_support. The settings declared at the top-level affect to all blocks, unless a particular block overwrites it. It‚Äôs a way to provide inheritance and configure all blocks at once.",
    "Note, however, that not all settings are relevant for all blocks. The settings section provides an opt-in/opt-out mechanism for themes, but it‚Äôs the block‚Äôs responsibility to add support for the features that are relevant to it. For example, if a block doesn‚Äôt implement the dropCap feature, a theme can‚Äôt enable it for such a block through theme.json.",

    "To retain backward compatibility, the existing add_theme_support declarations that configure the block editor are retrofit in the proper categories for the top-level section. For example, if a theme uses add_theme_support('disable-custom-colors'), it‚Äôll be the same as setting settings.color.custom to false. If the theme.json contains any settings, these will take precedence over the values declared via add_theme_support. This is the complete list of equivalences:",
    "Presets are part of the settings section. They are values that are shown to the user via some UI controls. By defining them via theme.json the engine can do more for themes, such as automatically translate the preset name or enqueue the corresponding CSS classes and custom properties.",

Any values declared within the custom field will be transformed to CSS Custom Properties following this naming schema: --wp--custom--<variable-name>.",

There are some blocks that want to opt-out from this default behavior. They can do so by explicitly telling the system which selector to use for them via the __experimentalSelector key within the supports section of its block.json file. Note that the block needs to be registered server-side for the __experimentalSelector field to be available to the style engine.",
    "A block can be styled using a reference to a root level style. This feature is supported by Gutenberg.\nIf you register a background color for the root using styles.color.background:",

    "Note that variations are a ‚Äúblock concept‚Äù, they only exist bound to blocks. The theme.json specification respects that distinction by only allowing variations at the block-level but not at the top-level. It‚Äôs also worth highlighting that only variations defined in the block.json file of the block are considered ‚Äúregistered‚Äù: so far, the style variations added via register_block_style or in the client are ignored, see this issue for more information.",
    "For example, this is how to provide styles for the existing plain variation for the core/quote block:",

    "Within this field themes can list the template parts present in the parts folder. For example, for a template part named my-template-part.html, the theme.json can declare the area term for the template part entity which is responsible for rendering the corresponding block variation (Header block, Footer block, etc.) in the editor. Defining this area term in the json will allow the setting to persist across all uses of that template part entity, as opposed to a block attribute that would only affect one block. Defining area as a block attribute is not recommended as this is only used ‚Äòbehind the scenes‚Äô to aid in bridging the gap between placeholder flows and entity creation.",
    "Currently block variations exist for ‚Äúheader‚Äù and ‚Äúfooter‚Äù values of the area term, any other values and template parts not defined in the json will default to the general template part block. Variations will be denoted by specific icons within the editor‚Äôs interface, will default to the corresponding semantic HTML element for the wrapper (this can also be overridden by the tagName attribute set on the template part block), and will contextualize the template part allowing more custom flows in future editor improvements.",
    "Within this field themes can list patterns to register from Pattern Directory. The patterns field is an array of pattern slugs from the Pattern Directory. Pattern slugs can be extracted by the url in single pattern view at the Pattern Directory. For example in this url https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/partner-logos` the slug ispartner-logos`.",
    "Code editors can pick up the schema and can provide help like tooltips, autocomplete, or schema validation in the editor. To use the schema in Visual Studio Code, add \"$schema\": \"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json\" to the beginning of your theme.json file.",
    "One thing you may have noticed is the naming schema used for the CSS Custom Properties the system creates, including the use of double hyphen, --, to separate the different ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù. Take the following examples.",
    "Presets such as --wp--preset--color--black can be divided into the following chunks:",
    "Custom properties such as --wp--custom--line-height--body, which can be divided into the following chunks:",

    "The algorithm to create CSS Variables out of the settings under the ‚Äúcustom‚Äù key works this way:",
    "This is for clarity, but also because we want a mechanism to parse back a variable name such --wp--custom--line-height--body to its object form in theme.json. We use the same separation for presets.",
    "A few notes about this process:",
    "In WordPress 5.8, the CSS for some of the presets defined by WordPress (font sizes, colors, and gradients) was loaded twice for most themes: in the block-library stylesheet plus in the global stylesheet. Additionally, there were slight differences in the CSS in both places.",
    "In WordPress 5.9 release, CSS of presets are consolidated into the global stylesheet, that is now loaded for all themes. Each preset value generates a single CSS Custom Property and a class, as in:",
    "For themes to override the default values they can use the theme.json and provide the same slug. Themes that do not use a theme.json can still override the default values by enqueuing some CSS that sets the corresponding CSS Custom Property.",
    "Example (sets a new value for the default large font size):",
    "In v1, when a user selected a link color for a specific block we attached a class to that block in the form of .wp-element-<ID> and then enqueued the following style:",
    "While this preserved user preferences at all times, the specificity was too strong and conflicted with some blocks with legit uses of an HTML element that shouldn‚Äôt be considered links. To address this issue, in WordPress 5.9 release, the !important was removed and updated the corresponding blocks to style the a elements with a specificity higher than the user link color, which now is:",
    "As a result of this change, it‚Äôs now the block author and theme author‚Äôs responsibility to make sure the user choices are respected at all times and that the link color provided by the user (specificity 011) is not overridden.",
    "For blocks that contain inner blocks, such as Group, Columns, Buttons, and Social Icons, blockGap controls the spacing between inner blocks. Depending on the layout of the block, the blockGap value will be output as either a vertical margin or a gap value. In the editor, the control for the blockGap value is called Block spacing, located in the Dimensions panel.",
    "The setting for blockGap is either a boolean or null value and is null by default. This allows an extra level of control over style output. The settings.spacing.blockGap setting in a theme.json file accepts the following values:",
    "The value defined for the root styles.spacing.blockGap style is also output as a CSS property, named --wp--style--block-gap.",
    "When you are actively developing with theme.json you may notice it takes 30+ seconds for your changes to show up in the browser, this is because theme.json is cached. To remove this caching issue, set either WP_DEBUG or SCRIPT_DEBUG to ‚Äòtrue‚Äô in your wp-config.php. This tells WordPress to skip the cache and always use fresh data.",
    "These features are experimental and part of the Gutenberg plugin.\nFor block theme features supported by WordPress 5.9 see the Theme Developer Handbook.",

    "In terms of block editor terminology this is any theme that defines its templates in the traditional .php file format, and that doesn‚Äôt have an index.html format template in the /block-templates or /templates folders. A Classic theme has the ability to provide configuration and styling options to the block editor, and block content, via Theme Supports, or by including a theme.json file. A theme does not have to be a Block theme in order to take advantage of some of the flexibility provided by the use of a theme.json file.",
    "This is any theme that has, at a minimum, an index.html format template in the /block-templates or /templates folders, and with templates  provided in form of block content markup. While many Block themes will make use of a theme.json file to provide configuration and styling settings, a theme.json is not a requirement of Block themes.

Since each content type allows or disallows certain kind of synchronization, it‚Äôs important to know what‚Äôs possible before creating to make maintenance easier in the future.",
    "At a high level, it‚Äôs important to recognize that not every piece of content can be updated across the entire site and that the method of creation greatly impacts what‚Äôs possible. As a result, it‚Äôs critical to spend time ahead of creation determining what you expect to need updates and to put that content in the appropriate format. This will make a huge difference in terms of future maintenance.",
    "Block theme design requires a mindset shift from the previous approach of designing large sections of a theme and controlling them via updates. While a holistic view of a design is still important when creating a custom theme project, blocks require that themers approach design on a more atomic level. This means starting from the block itself, typically through theme.json customizations. The goal is that each individual ‚Äúatom‚Äù (i.e., block) can be moved around, edited, deleted, and put back together without the entire design falling apart.",
    "The more that you approach design at the block level, the less need there is to propagate updates to things like patterns and templates across the entire site. If the atomic pieces are in place, their layout should not matter.",
    "How to manage block updates depends on the nature of the block itself. If the block depends on external data, then making it dynamic from start with the render_callback function is often a better choice as it provides more control. If the block‚Äôs structure is expected to change over time, then starting with the static block that uses save() method defining a default output is the recommended approach. Over time, it‚Äôs possible to go hybrid and include also the render_callback that can use the output from save as a fallback while processing an alternate output. Keep in mind that that flexibility and controls comes at the cost of additional processing during rendering. Another option is using static blocks that rely on managing updates with block deprecations. This will require you to manually update exist blocks.  Depending on your needs and comfortability, either approach can work. To get started on creating blocks and save time, you can use the Create Block tool.",
    "For content that you want updated later on, do not use patterns and instead rely on reusable blocks or template parts. Patterns cannot be updated after you insert one into your site. For context, you can think of Patterns as more like sample/example/starter content. While Patterns exposed in the Inserter might evolve over time, those changes won‚Äôt be automatically applied to any current usage of the pattern. Once inserted, patterns become completely detached from the original pattern unlike Reusable block or Template Part block.",
    "If needed, one potential workaround for patterns with custom styles is to add a class name to the wrapping block for a pattern. For example, the following adds a themeslug-special class to a Group block:",
    "It is not fool-proof because users can modify the class via the editor UI.  However, because this setting is under the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù panel it is likely to stay intact in most instances. This gives theme authors some CSS control for some pattern types, allowing them to update existing uses. However, it does not prevent users from making massive alterations that cannot be updated.",
    "As the name suggests, these blocks are inherently synced across your site. Keep in mind that there are currently limitations with relying on reusable blocks to handle certain updates since content, HTML structure, and styles will all stay in sync when updates happen. If you require more nuance than that, this is a key element to factor in and a dynamic block might be a better approach.",
    "Because block themes allow users to directly edit templates and template parts, how changes are managed need to be adjusted in light of the greater access given to users. For context, when templates or template parts are changed by the user, the updated templates from the theme update don‚Äôt show for the user. Only new users of the theme or users who have not yet edited a template are experiencing the updated template. If users haven‚Äôt modified the files then the changes you make on the file system will be reflected on the user‚Äôs sites ‚Äì you just need to update the files and they‚Äôll get the changes. However if they have made changes to their templates then the only way you can update their templates is to:",
    "Generally speaking, if a user has made changes to templates then it‚Äôs recommended to leave the templates as is, unless agreed upon with the user (ie in an agency setting).",
    "One thing to be mindful of when updating templates is inserting references to new or different template parts.  For example, the templates/page.html template could insert a parts/header.html part in version 1.0 but change that reference to parts/header-alt.html in version 2.0.  Some developers may see this as a ‚Äúworkaround‚Äù in instances where users modified the original header.html.  However, this is likely to break a user‚Äôs customized design since the page.html template would no longer reference the correct part unless they also modified and saved the page template.",
    "Likewise, it is generally poor practice to delete template parts in theme updates.  In this scenario, users could create custom top-level templates that include a call to the part and expect it to continue existing.",

    "The guide will walk through creating a basic block, but recommended to go through the Create Block tutorial for a deeper understanding of creating custom blocks.",
    "You will need:",
    "A complete meta-block example is available that you can use as a reference for your setup.",
    "A post meta field is a WordPress object used to store extra data about a post. You need to first register a new meta field prior to use. See Managing Post Metadata to learn more about post meta.",
    "When registering the field, note the show_in_rest parameter. This ensures the data will be included in the REST API, which the block editor uses to load and save meta data. See the register_post_meta function definition for extra information.",
    "Additionally, your post type needs to support custom-fields for register_post_meta function to work",
    "To register the field, add the following to your PHP plugin:",
    "With the meta field registered in the previous step, next create a new block to display the field value to the user.",
    "The hook useEntityProp can be used by the blocks to get or change meta values.",
    "Add this code to the JavaScript src/index.js:",
    "Confirm this works by creating a post and add the Meta Block. You will see your field that you can type a value in. When you save the post, either as a draft or published, the post meta value will be saved too. You can verify by\nsaving and reloading your draft, the form will still be filled in on reload.",
    "You could also confirm the data is saved by checking the database table wp_postmeta and confirm the new post id contains the new field data.",
    "Troubleshooting: Be sure to build your code between changes, you updated the PHP code from Step 1, and JavaScript files are enqueued. Check the build output and developer console for errors.",
    "You can use the post meta data stored in the last step in multiple ways.",
    "The first example uses the value from the post meta field and appends it to the end of the post content wrapped in a H4 tag.",
    "You can also use the post meta data in other blocks. For this example the data is loaded at the end of every Paragraph block when it is rendered, ie. shown to the user. You can replace this for any core or custom block types as needed.",
    "In PHP, use the register_block_type function to set a callback when the block is rendered to include the meta value.",
    "One problem using a meta block is the block is easy for an author to forget, since it requires being added to each post. You solve this by using block templates. A block template is a predefined list of block items per post type. Templates allow you to specify a default initial state for a post type.",
    "For this example, you use a template to automatically insert the meta block at the top of a post.",
    "Add the following code to the myguten-meta-block.php file:",
    "You can also add other block types in the array, including placeholders, or even lock down a post to a set of specific blocks. Templates are a powerful tool for controlling the editing experience, see the documentation linked above for more.",
    "This guide showed how using blocks you can read and write to post meta. See the section below for backward compatibility with existing meta boxes.",
    "Before converting meta boxes to blocks, it may be easier to test if a meta box works with the block editor, and explicitly mark it as such.",
    "If a meta box doesn‚Äôt work with the block editor, and updating it to work correctly is not an option, the next step is to add the __block_editor_compatible_meta_box argument to the meta box declaration:",
    "WordPress won‚Äôt show the meta box but a message saying that it isn‚Äôt compatible with the block editor, including a link to the Classic Editor plugin. By default, __block_editor_compatible_meta_box is true.",
    "After a meta box is converted to a block, it can be declared as existing for backward compatibility:",
    "When the block editor is used, this meta box will no longer be displayed in the meta box area, as it now only exists for backward compatibility purposes. It will display as before in the classic editor.",
    "On each block editor page load, we register an action that collects the meta box data to determine if an area is empty. The original global state is reset upon collection of meta box data.",
    "See register_and_do_post_meta_boxes.",
    "It will run through the functions and hooks that post.php runs to register meta boxes; namely add_meta_boxes, add_meta_boxes_{$post->post_type}, and do_meta_boxes.",
    "Meta boxes are filtered to strip out any core meta boxes, standard custom taxonomy meta boxes, and any meta boxes that have declared themselves as only existing for backward compatibility purposes.",
    "Then each location for this particular type of meta box is checked for whether it is active. If it is not empty a value of true is stored, if it is empty a value of false is stored. This meta box location data is then dispatched by the editor Redux store in INITIALIZE_META_BOX_STATE.",
    "Ideally, this could be done at instantiation of the editor and help simplify this flow. However, it is not possible to know the meta box state before admin_enqueue_scripts, where we are calling initializeEditor(). This will have to do, unless we want to move initializeEditor() to fire in the footer or at some point after admin_head. With recent changes to editor bootstrapping this might now be possible. Test with ACF to make sure.",
    "When rendering the block editor, the meta boxes are rendered to a hidden div #metaboxes.",
    "The Redux store will hold all meta boxes as inactive by default. When\nINITIALIZE_META_BOX_STATE comes in, the store will update any active meta box areas by setting the isActive flag to true. Once this happens React will check for the new props sent in by Redux on the MetaBox component. If that MetaBox is now active, instead of rendering null, a MetaBoxArea component will be rendered. The MetaBox component is the container component that mediates between the MetaBoxArea and the Redux Store. If no meta boxes are active, nothing happens. This will be the default behavior, as all core meta boxes have been stripped.",
    "When the component renders it will store a reference to the meta boxes container and retrieve the meta boxes HTML from the prefetch location.",
    "When the post is updated, only meta box areas that are active will be submitted. This prevents unnecessary requests. No extra revisions are created by the meta box submissions. A Redux action will trigger on REQUEST_POST_UPDATE for any active meta box. See editor/effects.js. The REQUEST_META_BOX_UPDATES action will set that meta box‚Äôs state to isUpdating. The isUpdating prop will be sent into the MetaBoxArea and cause a form submission.",
    "When the meta box area is saving, we display an updating overlay, to prevent users from changing the form values while a save is in progress.",
    "An example save url would look like:",
    "mysite.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1&action=edit&meta-box-loader=1",
    "This url is automatically passed into React via a _wpMetaBoxUrl global variable.",
    "This page mimics the post.php post form, so when it is submitted it will fire all of the normal hooks and actions, and have the proper global state to correctly fire any PHP meta box mumbo jumbo without needing to modify any existing code. On successful submission, React will signal a handleMetaBoxReload to remove the updating overlay.",
    "Most PHP meta boxes should continue to work in the block editor, but some meta boxes that include advanced functionality could break. Here are some common reasons why meta boxes might not work as expected in the block editor:",
    "Please also note that if your plugin triggers a PHP warning or notice to be output on the page, this will cause the HTML document type (<!DOCTYPE html>) to be output incorrectly. This will cause the browser to render using ‚ÄúQuirks Mode‚Äù, which is a compatibility layer that gets enabled when the browser doesn‚Äôt know what type of document it is parsing. The block editor is not meant to work in this mode, but it can appear to be working just fine. If you encounter issues such as meta boxes overlaying the editor or other layout issues, please check the raw page source of your document to see that the document type definition is the first thing output on the page. There will also be a warning in the JavaScript console, noting the issue.",
    "The JavaScript language continues to evolve, the syntax used to write JavaScript code is not fixed but changes over time. Ecma International is the organization that sets the standard for the language, officially called ECMAScript. A new standard for JavaScript is published each year, the 6th edition published in 2015 is often referred to as ES6. Our usage would more appropriately be ESNext referring to the latest standard. The build step is what converts this latest syntax of JavaScript to a version understood by browsers.",
    "Here are some common ESNext syntax patterns used throughout the Gutenberg project.",
    "The¬†destructuring assignment¬†syntax allows you to pull apart arrays, or properties from objects into their own variable.",
    "For the object const obj = { foo: \"bar\" }",
    "Creating and assigning a new variable foo can be done in a single step: const { foo } = obj;",
    "The curly brackets on the left side tells JavaScript to inspect the object obj for the property foo and assign its value to the new variable of the same name.",
    "Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for defining a function; this is such a common task in JavaScript that having a syntax a bit shorter is quite helpful.",
    "Before you might define a function like:",
    "Using arrow function, you can define the same using:",
    "Or even shorter, if the function is only a single-line you can omit the\ncurly braces:",
    "In the examples above, using console.log we aren‚Äôt too concerned about the return values. However, when using arrow functions in this way, the return value is set whatever the line returns.",
    "For example, our save function could be shortened from:",
    "To:",
    "There are even more ways to shorten code, but you don‚Äôt want to take it too far and make it harder to read what is going on.",
    "The import statement is used to import variables or functions from an exported file. You can use destructuring on imports, for example:",
    "This will look in the @wordpress/components package for the exported TextControl variable.",
    "A package or file can also set a default export, this is imported without using the curly brackets. For example",
    "To import, you would use:",
    "Note, you can also shorten edit: edit to just edit as shown above. JavaScript will automatically assign the property edit to the value of edit. This is another form of destructuring.",
    "It helps to become familiar with the ESNext syntax and the common shorter forms. It will give you a greater understanding of reading code examples and what is going on.",
    "Here are a few more resources that may help",
    "ESNext is JavaScript written using syntax and features only available in a version newer than browser support‚Äîthe support browser versions is referred to as ECMAScript 5 (ES5). JSX is a custom syntax extension to JavaScript, created by React project, that allows you to write JavaScript using a familiar HTML tag-like syntax.",
    "See the ESNext syntax documentation for explanation and examples about common code differences between standard JavaScript and ESNext.",
    "Let‚Äôs set up your development environment to use these syntaxes, we‚Äôll cover development for your plugin to work with the Gutenberg project (ie: the block editor). If you want to develop on Gutenberg itself, see the Getting Started documentation.",
    "Browsers cannot interpret or run ESNext and JSX syntaxes, so we must use a transformation step to convert these syntaxes to code that browsers can understand.",
    "There are a few reasons to use ESNext and this extra step of transformation:",
    "There are different tools that can perform this transformation or build step; WordPress uses webpack and Babel.",
    "webpack is a pluggable tool that processes JavaScript and creates a compiled bundle that runs in a browser. Babel transforms JavaScript from one format to another. You use Babel as a plugin to webpack to transform both ESNext and JSX to JavaScript.",
    "The @wordpress/scripts package abstracts these libraries away to standardize and simplify development, so you won‚Äôt need to handle the details for configuring webpack or babel. See the @wordpress/scripts package documentation for configuration details.",
    "If you prefer a quick start, you can use one of the examples from the Gutenberg Examples repository and skip below. Each one of the -esnext directories in the examples repository contain the necessary files for working with ESNext and JSX.",
    "Both webpack and Babel are tools written in JavaScript and run using Node.js (node). Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript outside of a browser. Simply put, node allows you to run JavaScript code on the command-line.",
    "First, you need to set up Node.js for your development environment. The steps required depend on your operating system, if you have a package manager installed, setup can be as straightforward as:",
    "If you are not using a package manager, see the developer environment setup documentation for setting up Node using nvm, or see the official Node.js download page for installers and binaries.",
    "Note: The build tools and process occur on the command-line, so basic familiarity using a terminal application is required. Some text editors have a terminal built-in that is fine to use; Visual Studio Code and PhpStorm are two popular options.",
    "The Node Package Manager (npm) is a tool included with node. npm allows you to install and manage JavaScript packages. npm can also generate and process a special file called package.json, that contains information about your project and the packages your project uses.",
    "To start a new node project, first create a directory to work in:",
    "You create a new package.json running npm init in your terminal. This will walk you through creating your package.json file:",
    "The next step is to install the packages required. You can install packages using the npm command npm install. If you pass the --save-dev parameter, npm will write the package as a dev dependency in the package.json file. The --save-exact parameter instructs npm to save an exact version of a dependency, not a range of valid versions. See npm install documentation for more details.",
    "Run npm install --save-dev --save-exact @wordpress/scripts",
    "After installing, a node_modules directory is created with the modules and their dependencies.",
    "Also, if you look at package.json file it will include a new section:",
    "The @wordpress/scripts package handles the dependencies and default configuration for webpack and Babel. The scripts package expects the source file to compile to be found at src/index.js, and will save the compiled output to build/index.js.",
    "With that in mind, let‚Äôs set up a basic block. Create a file at src/index.js with the following content:",
    "To configure npm to run a script, you use the scripts section in package.json webpack:",
    "You can then run the build using: npm run build.",
    "After the build finishes, you will see the built file created at build/index.js. Enqueue this file in the admin screen as you would any JavaScript in WordPress, see loading JavaScript step in this tutorial, and the block will load in the editor.",
    "The build command in @wordpress/scripts runs in ‚Äúproduction‚Äù mode. This shrinks the code down so it downloads faster, but makes it difficult to read in the process. You can use the start command which runs in development mode that does not shrink the code, and additionally continues a running process to watch the source file for more changes and rebuilds as you develop.",
    "The start command can be added to the same scripts section of package.json:",
    "Now, when you run npm start a watcher will run in the terminal. You can then edit away in your text editor; after each save, it will automatically build. You can then use the familiar edit/save/reload development process.",
    "Note: keep an eye on your terminal for any errors. If you make a typo or syntax error, the build will fail and the error will be in the terminal.",
    "Because a typical node_modules folder will contain thousands of files that change with every software update, you should exclude node_modules/ from your source control. If you ever start from a fresh clone, simply run npm install in the same folder your package.json is located to pull your required packages.",
    "Likewise, you do not need to include node_modules or any of the above configuration files in your plugin because they will be bundled inside the file that webpack builds. Be sure to enqueue the build/index.js file in your plugin PHP. This is the main JavaScript file needed for your block to run.",
    "Using wp-scripts ver 5.0.0+ build step will also produce an index.asset.php file that contains an array of dependencies and a version number for your block. For our simple example above, it is something like:\narray('dependencies' => array('wp-element', 'wp-polyfill'), 'version' => 'fc93c4a9675c108725227db345898bcc');",
    "Here is how to use this asset file to automatically set the dependency list for enqueuing the script. This prevents having to manually update the dependencies, it will be created based on the package imports used within your block.",
    "See ESNext blocks in gutenberg-examples repo for full examples.",
    "Yes, the initial setup is a bit more involved, but the additional features and benefits are usually worth the trade off in setup time.",
    "With a setup in place, the standard workflow is:",
    "Historically, JavaScript files loaded in a web page share the same scope. This means that a global variable declared in one file will be seen by the code in other files.",
    "To see how this works, create a web page that loads three JavaScript files. The first.js file will be:",
    "Let‚Äôs create second.js as:",
    "And, finally, third.js:",
    "When loaded on the same page, first.js and second.js will output the plugin name declared within itself. They will override the value of the global pluginName variable if one was already declared. It‚Äôs not known what gets printed in the console when third.js is executed, though ‚Äì it depends on the value of the global pluginName variable when third.js is executed, which will depend on the order the files are loaded.",
    "This behavior can be problematic, and is the reason we need to scope the code. By scoping the code‚Äîensuring each file is isolated from each other‚Äîwe can prevent values unexpectedly changing.",
    "In JavaScript, you can scope your code by writing it within a function. Functions have ‚Äúlocal scope‚Äù, or a scope that is specific only to that function. Additionally, in JavaScript you can write anonymous functions, functions without a name, which will also prevent your function name from being overridden in the global scope.",
    "Taking advantage of these two JavaScript features, first.js could be scoped as:",
    "second.js as:",
    "And third.js:",
    "With this trick, the different files won‚Äôt override each other‚Äôs variables. Unfortunately, they also won‚Äôt work as expected, because these functions are being called by no one. We‚Äôve only defined the functions; we haven‚Äôt executed them yet.",
    "It turns out there are a few ways to execute anonymous functions in JavaScript, but the most popular is this:",
    "You wrap your function between parentheses, and then call it like any other named function. This pattern is known as Immediately-Invoked Function Expression, or IIFE for short.",
    "This is first.js written as an IIFE:",
    "And this is second.js:",
    "And this is third.js:",
    "The code in first.js and second.js is unaffected by other variables in the global scope, so it‚Äôs safe and deterministic.",
    "On the other hand, third.js doesn‚Äôt declare a pluginName variable, but needs to be provided one. IIFEs still allow you to take a variable from the global scope and pass it into your function. Provided that there was a global window.pluginName variable, we could rewrite third.js as:",
    "At the beginning we mentioned that:",
    "Historically, JavaScript files loaded in a web page share the same scope.",
    "Notice the historically.",
    "JavaScript has evolved quite a bit since its creation. As of 2015, the language supports modules, also known as ES6 modules, that introduce separate scope per file: a global variable in first.js wouldn‚Äôt be exposed to second.js. This feature is already supported by modern browsers, but not all of them do. If your code needs to run in browsers that don‚Äôt support modules, your last resort is using IIFEs.",
    "The Block Editor Handbook shows JavaScript examples in two syntaxes: JSX and Plain.",
    "Plain refers to JavaScript code compatible with WordPress‚Äôs minimum target for browser support without requiring a transpilation step. This step is commonly referred to as a build process.",
    "‚ÄúJSX‚Äù doesn‚Äôt refer to a specific version of JavaScript, but refers to the latest language definition plus JSX syntax, a syntax that blends HTML and JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to read and write markup code, but does require a build step to transpile into code compatible with browsers. Webpack and babel are the tools that perform this transpilation step.",
    "For simplicity, the JavaScript tutorial uses the Plain definition, without JSX. This code can run straight in your browser and does not require an additional build step. In many cases, it is perfectly fine to follow the same approach for simple plugins or experimenting. As your codebase grows in complexity it might be a good idea to switch to JSX. You will find the majority of code and documentation across the block editor uses JSX.",
    "See the JavaScript Build Setup documentation for setting up a development environment using JSX syntax.",
    "See the ESNext syntax documentation for explanation and examples about common code differences between standard JavaScript and more modern approaches.",
    "If you‚Äôre having trouble getting your JavaScript code to work, here are a few tips on how to find errors to help you troubleshoot.",
    "The console log is a JavaScript developer‚Äôs best friend. It is a good practice to work with it open, as it displays errors and notices in one place. See Mozilla‚Äôs JavaScript console documentation for more.",
    "To open the JavaScript console, find the correct key combination for your browser and OS:",
    "Your first step in debugging should be to check the JavaScript console for any errors. Here is an example, which shows a syntax error on line 6:",
    "You can also write directly to the console from your JavaScript code for debugging and checking variable values. Use the console.log function like so:",
    "Or if you want to include a message and variable, in this case display the contents of settings variable:",
    "You can also write JavaScript directly in the console if you want to test a short command. The commands you run apply to the open browser window. Try this example with the wp.data package to count how many blocks are in the editor. Play with it and also try to use the console to browse available functions.",
    "If you would like to pause code execution at a certain line of code, you can write debugger; anywhere in your code. Once the browser sees the statement debugger;, it will pause execution of your code. This allows you to inspect all variables around the debugger statement, which is very useful. See this MDN page for more information.",
    "If you are not seeing your changes, and no errors, check that your JavaScript file is being enqueued. Open the page source in your browser‚Äôs web inspector (some browsers may allow you to view the page source by right clicking on the page and selecting ‚ÄúView Page Source‚Äù), and look for the <script> tag that loads your file. In the JavaScript tutorial example, you would search for myguten.js and confirm it is being loaded.",
    "If you do not see the file being loaded, double check the enqueue function is correct. You can also check your server logs to see if there is an error messages.",
    "Add a test message to confirm your JavaScript is loading, add a console.log(\"Here\"); at the top of your code, and confirm the message is shown. If not, it is likely the file is not loading properly, review the loading JavaScript page for details on enqueuing JavaScript properly.",
    "The console log will show an error if a dependency your JavaScript code uses has not been declared and loaded in the browser. In the JavaScript tutorial example, if myguten.js script is enqueued without declaring the wp-blocks dependency, the console log will show:",
    "You can correct by checking your wp_enqueue_script function includes all packages listed that are used:",
    "For automated dependency management, it is recommended to use wp-scripts to build step your JavaScript.",

In contrast to block locking, which disables the ability to move or remove blocks, content only editing is both designed for use at the pattern or template level and hides all design tools, while still allowing for the ability to edit the content of the blocks. This provides a great way to simplify the interface for users and preserve a design. When this option is added, the following changes occur:",
    "This option can be applied to Columns, Cover, and Group blocks as well as third-party blocks that have the templateLock attribute in its block.json. To adopt this functionality, you need to use \"templateLock\":\"contentOnly\". Here‚Äôs an example of a pattern with this functionality in place.

For example, you can provide custom patterns to use when creating a new page while also limiting the amount of customization that can be done to aspects of them, like only allowing certain preset colors to be used for the background of a Cover block or locking down what blocks can be deleted. When considering the approaches to take, think about the specific ways you might want to both open up the experience and curate it.",
    "In the previous part we added an ability to create new pages,\nand in this part we will add a Delete feature to our app.",

    "Once the REST API request is finished, you will notice one of the pages has disappeared from the list.

    "Let‚Äôs dispatch that action when DeletePageButton is clicked:",
    "It may take a few moments for the REST API request to finish after clicking the Delete button. Let‚Äôs communicate that with a <Spinner /> component similarly to what we did in the previous parts of this tutorial.",
    "We‚Äôll need the isDeletingEntityRecord selector for that. It is similar to the isSavingEntityRecord selector we‚Äôve already seen in part 3: it returns true or false and never issues any HTTP requests:",
    "Here‚Äôs what it looks like in action:",
    "We optimistically assumed that a delete operation would always succeed. Unfortunately, under the hood, it is a REST API request that can fail in many ways:",
    "To tell the user when any of these errors happen, we need to extract the error information using the getLastEntityDeleteError selector:",
    "Here‚Äôs how we can apply it in DeletePageButton:",
    "The error object comes from the @wordpress/api-fetch and contains information about the error. It has the following properties:",
    "There are many ways to turn that object into an error message, but in this tutorial, we will display the error.message.",
    "WordPress has an established pattern of displaying status information using the Snackbar component. Here‚Äôs what it looks like in the Widgets editor:",
    "Let‚Äôs use the same type of notifications in our plugin! There are two parts to this:",

    "WordPress conveniently provides us with all the React components we need to render notifications. A component called Snackbar represents a single notification:",
    "We won‚Äôt use Snackbar directly, though. We‚Äôll use the SnackbarList component, which can display multiple notices using smooth animations and automatically hide them after a few seconds. In fact, WordPress uses the same component used in the Widgets editor and other wp-admin pages!",
    "Let‚Äôs create our own Notifications components:",
    "The basic structure is in place, but the list of notifications it renders is empty. How do we populate it? We‚Äôll lean on the same package as WordPress: @wordpress/notices.",
    "Here‚Äôs how:",
    "This tutorial is focused on managing the pages and won‚Äôt discuss the above snippet in detail. If you‚Äôre interested in the details of @wordpress/notices, the handbook page is a good place to start.",
    "Now we‚Äôre ready to tell the user about any errors that may have occurred.",
    "With the SnackbarNotices component in place, we‚Äôre ready to dispatch some notifications! Here‚Äôs how:",
    "Great! DeletePageButton is now fully aware of errors. Let‚Äôs see that error message in action. We‚Äôll trigger an invalid delete and let it fail. One way to do this is to multiply the pageId by a large number:",
    "Once you refresh the page and click any Delete button, you should see the following error message:",
    "Fantastic! We can now remove the pageId = pageId * 1000; line.",
    "Let‚Äôs now try actually deleting a page. Here‚Äôs what you should see after refreshing your browser and clicking the Delete button:",
    "And that‚Äôs it!",
    "All the pieces are in place, great! Here‚Äôs all the changes we‚Äôve made in this chapter:",
    "In the previous part we created an Edit page feature, and in this part we will add a Create page feature. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what we‚Äôre going to build:",
    "Let‚Äôs start by building a button to display the create page form. It‚Äôs similar to an Edit button we have built in the part 3:",
    "Great! Now let‚Äôs make MyFirstApp display our shiny new button:",
    "The final result should look as follows:",
    "Now that the button is in place, we can focus entirely on building the form. This tutorial is about managing data, so we will not build a complete page editor. Instead, the form will only contain one field: post title.",
    "Luckily, the EditPageForm we built in part three already takes us 80% of the way there. The bulk of the user interface is already available, and we will reuse it in the CreatePageForm. Let‚Äôs start by extracting the form UI into a separate component:",
    "This code quality change should not alter anything about how the application works. Let‚Äôs try to edit a page just to be sure:",
    "Great! The edit form is still there, and now we have a building block to power the new CreatePageForm.",
    "The only thing that CreatePageForm component must do is to provide the following seven properties needed to render the PageForm component:",
    "Let‚Äôs see how we can do that:",
    "The EditPageForm updated and saved an existing entity record that lived in the Redux state. Because of that, we relied on the editedEntityRecords selector.",
    "In case of the CreatePageForm however, there is no pre-existing entity record. There is only an empty form. Anything that the user types is local to that form, which means we can keep track of it using the React‚Äôs useState hook:",
    "In the EditPageForm, we dispatched the saveEditedEntityRecord('postType', 'page', pageId ) action to save the edits that lived in the Redux state.",
    "In the CreatePageForm however, we do not have any edits in the Redux state, nor we do have a pageId. The action we need to dispatch in this case is called saveEntityRecord (without the word Edited in the name) and it accepts an object representing the new entity record instead of a pageId.",
    "The data passed to saveEntityRecord is sent via a POST request to the appropriate REST API endpoint. For example, dispatching the following action:",
    "Triggers a POST request to the /wp/v2/pages WordPress REST API endpoint with a  single field in the request body: title=Test.",
    "Now that we know more about saveEntityRecord, let‚Äôs use it in CreatePageForm.",
    "There is one more detail to address: our newly created pages are not yet picked up by the PagesList. Accordingly to the REST API documentation, the /wp/v2/pages endpoint creates (POST requests) pages with status=draft by default, but returns (GET requests) pages with status=publish. The solution is to pass the status parameter explicitly:",
    "Go ahead and apply that change to your local CreatePageForm component, and let‚Äôs tackle the remaining two props.",
    "The EditPageForm  retrieved the error and progress information via the getLastEntitySaveError and isSavingEntityRecord selectors. In both cases, it passed the following three arguments: ( 'postType', 'page', pageId ).",
    "In CreatePageForm however, we do not have a pageId. What now? We can skip the pageId argument to retrieve the information about the entity record without any id ‚Äì this will be the newly created one. The useSelect call is thus very similar to the one from EditPageForm:",
    "And that‚Äôs it! Here‚Äôs what our new form looks like in action:",
    "Here‚Äôs everything we built in this chapter in one place:",
    "All that‚Äôs left is to refresh the page and enjoy the form:",
    "This part is about adding an Edit feature to our app. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what we‚Äôre going to build:",
    "We can‚Äôt have an Edit form without an Edit button, so let‚Äôs start by adding one to our PagesList component:",
    "The only change in PagesList is the additional column labeled Actions:",
    "Our button looks nice but doesn‚Äôt do anything yet. To display an edit form, we need to have one first ‚Äì let‚Äôs create it:",
    "Now let‚Äôs make the button display the form we just created. As this tutorial is not focused on web design, we will wire the two together using a component that requires the least amount of code: Modal. Let‚Äôs update PageEditButton accordingly:",
    "When you click the Edit button now, you should see the following modal:",
    "Great! We now have a basic user interface to work with.",
    "We want the EditPageForm to display the title of the currently edited page. You may have noticed that it doesn‚Äôt receive a page prop, only pageId. That‚Äôs okay. Gutenberg Data allows us to easily access entity records from any component.",
    "In this case, we need to use the getEntityRecord selector. The list of records is already available thanks to the getEntityRecords call in MyFirstApp, so there won‚Äôt even be any additional HTTP requests involved ‚Äì we‚Äôll get the cached record right away.",
    "Here‚Äôs how you can try it in your browser‚Äôs dev tools:",
    "Let‚Äôs update EditPageForm accordingly:",
    "Now it should look like this:",
    "There‚Äôs one problem with our Page title field: you can‚Äôt edit it. It receives a fixed value but doesn‚Äôt update it when typing. We need an onChange handler.",
    "You may have seen a pattern similar to this one in other React apps. It‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúcontrolled component‚Äù:",
    "Updating entity records in Gutenberg Data is similar but instead of using setTitle to store in local (component level) state, we use the editEntityRecord action which stores the updates in the Redux state. Here‚Äôs how you can try it out in your browser‚Äôs dev tools:",
    "At this point, you may ask how is editEntityRecord better than useState? The answer is that it offers a few features you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise get.",
    "Firstly, we can save the changes as easily as we retrieve the data and ensure that all caches will be correctly updated.",
    "Secondly, the changes applied via editEntityRecord are easily undo-able via the undo and redo actions.",
    "Lastly, because the changes live in the Redux state, they are ‚Äúglobal‚Äù and can be accessed by other components. For example, we could make the PagesList display the currently edited title.",
    "To that last point, let‚Äôs see what happens when we use getEntityRecord to access the entity record we just updated:",
    "It doesn‚Äôt reflect the edits. What‚Äôs going on?",
    "Well, <PagesList /> renders the data returned by getEntityRecord(). If getEntityRecord() reflected the updated title, then anything the user types in the TextControl would be immediately displayed inside <PagesList />, too. This is not what we want. The edits shouldn‚Äôt leak outside the form until the user decides to save them.",
    "Gutenberg Data solves this problem by making a distinction between Entity Records and Edited Entity Records. Entity Records reflect the data from the API and ignore any local edits, while Edited Entity Records also have all the local edits applied on top. Both co-exist in the Redux state at the same time.",
    "Let‚Äôs see what happens if we call getEditedEntityRecord:",
    "As you can see, the title of an Entity Record is an object, but the title of an Edited Entity record is a string.",
    "This is no accident. Fields like title, excerpt, and content may contain shortcodes or dynamic blocks, which means they can only be rendered on the server. For such fields, the REST API exposes both the raw markup and the rendered string. For example, in the block editor, content.rendered could used as a visual preview, and content.raw could be used to populate the code editor.",
    "So why is the content of an Edited Entity Record a string? Since Javascript is not be able to properly render arbitrary block markup, it stores only the raw markup without the rendered part. And since that‚Äôs a string, the entire field becomes a string.",
    "We can now update EditPageForm accordingly. We can access the actions using the useDispatch hook similarly to how we use useSelect to access selectors:",
    "We added an onChange handler to keep track of edits via the editEntityRecord action and then changed the selector to getEditedEntityRecord so that page.title always reflects the changes.",
    "This is what it looks like now:",
    "Now that we can edit the page title let‚Äôs also make sure we can save it. In Gutenberg data, we save changes to the WordPress REST API using the saveEditedEntityRecord action. It sends the request, processes the result, and updates the cached data in the Redux state.",
    "Here‚Äôs an example you may try in your browser‚Äôs dev tools:",
    "The above snippet saved a new title. Unlike before, getEntityRecord now reflects the updated title:",
    "Entity records are updated to reflect any saved changes right after the REST API request is finished.",
    "This is how the EditPageForm looks like with a working Save button:",
    "It works, but there‚Äôs still one thing to fix: the form modal doesn‚Äôt automatically close because we never call onSaveFinished. Lucky for us, saveEditedEntityRecord returns a promise that resolves once the save operation is finished. Let‚Äôs take advantage of it in EditPageForm:",
    "We optimistically assumed that a save operation would always succeed. Unfortunately, it may fail in many ways:",
    "To tell the user when any of these happens, we have to make two adjustments. We don‚Äôt want to close the form modal when the update fails. The promise returned by saveEditedEntityRecord is resolved with an updated record only if the update actually worked. When something goes wrong, it resolves with an empty value. Let‚Äôs use it to keep the modal open:",
    "Great! Now, let‚Äôs display an error message. The failure details can be grabbed using the getLastEntitySaveError selector:",
    "Here‚Äôs how we can use it in EditPageForm:",
    "Great! EditPageForm is now fully aware of errors.",
    "Let‚Äôs see that error message in action. We‚Äôll trigger an invalid update and let it fail. The post title is hard to break, so let‚Äôs set a date property to -1 instead ‚Äì that‚Äôs a guaranteed validation error:",
    "Once you refresh the page, open the form, change the title, and hit save, you should see the following error message:",
    "Fantastic! We can now restore the previous version of handleChange and move on to the next step.",
    "There is one last problem with our form: no visual feedback. We can‚Äôt be quite sure whether the Save button worked until either the form disappears or an error message shows.",
    "We‚Äôre going to clear it up and communicate two states to the user: Saving and No changes detected. The relevant selectors are isSavingEntityRecord and hasEditsForEntityRecord. Unlike getEntityRecord, they never issue any HTTP requests but only return the current entity record state.",
    "Let‚Äôs use them in EditPageForm:",
    "We can now use isSaving and hasEdits to display a spinner when saving is in progress and grey out the save button when there are no edits:",
    "Note that we disable the save button when there are no edits and when the page is currently being saved. This is to prevent the user from accidentally pressing the button twice.",
    "Also, interrupting a save in progress is not supported by @wordpress/data so we also conditionally disabled the cancel button.",
    "All the pieces are in place, great! Here‚Äôs everything we built in this chapter in one place:",
    "In this part, we will build a filterable list of all WordPress pages. This is what the app will look like at the end of this section:",
    "Let‚Äôs see how we can get there step by step.",
    "Let‚Äôs start by building a minimal React component to display the list of pages:",
    "Note that this component does not fetch any data yet, only presents the hardcoded list of pages. When you refresh the page, you should see the following:",
    "The hard-coded sample page isn‚Äôt very useful. We want to display your actual WordPress pages so let‚Äôs fetch the actual list of pages from the WordPress REST API.",
    "Before we start, let‚Äôs confirm we actually have some pages to fetch. Within WPAdmin, Navigate to Pages using the sidebar menu and ensure it shows at least four or five Pages:",
    "If it doesn‚Äôt, go ahead and create a few pages ‚Äì you can use the same titles as on the screenshot above. Be sure to publish and not just save them.",
    "Now that we have the data to work with, let‚Äôs dive into the code. We will take advantage of the @wordpress/core-data package which provides resolvers, selectors, and actions to work with the WordPress core API. @wordpress/core-data builds on top of the @wordpress/data package.",
    "To fetch the list of pages, we will use the getEntityRecords selector. In broad strokes, it will issue the correct API request, cache the results, and return the list of the records we need. Here‚Äôs how to use it:",
    "If you run that following snippet in your browser‚Äôs dev tools, you will see it returns null. Why? The pages are only requested by the getEntityRecords resolver after first running the selector. If you wait a moment and re-run it, it will return the list of all pages.",
    "Note: To run this type of command directly make sure your browser is displaying an instance of the block editor (any page will do). Otherwise the select( 'core' ) function won‚Äôt be available, and you‚Äôll get an error.",
    "Similarly, the MyFirstApp component needs to re-run the selector once the data is available. That‚Äôs exactly what the useSelect hook does:",
    "Note that we use an import statement inside index.js. This enables the plugin to automatically load the dependencies using wp_enqueue_script. Any references to coreDataStore are compiled to the same wp.data reference we use in browser‚Äôs devtools.",
    "useSelect takes two arguments: a callback and dependencies. In broad strokes, it re-runs the callback whenever either the dependencies or the underlying data store changes. You can learn more about useSelect in the data module documentation.",
    "Putting it together, we get the following code:",
    "Note that post title may contain HTML entities like &aacute;, so we need to use the decodeEntities function to replace them with the symbols they represent like √°.",
    "Refreshing the page should display a list similar to this one:",
    "The list of pages is short for now; however, the longer it grows, the harder it is to work with. WordPress admins typically solves this problem with a search box ‚Äì let‚Äôs implement one too!",
    "Let‚Äôs start by adding a search field:",
    "Note that instead of using an input tag, we took advantage of the SearchControl component. This is what it looks like:",
    "The field starts empty, and the contents are stored in the searchTerm state value. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with the useState hook, you can learn more in React‚Äôs documentation.",
    "We can now request only the pages matching the searchTerm.",
    "After checking with the WordPress API documentation, we see that the /wp/v2/pages endpoint accepts a search query parameter and uses it to  limit results to those matching a string. But how can we use it? We can pass custom query parameters as the third argument to getEntityRecords as below:",
    "Running that snippet in your browser‚Äôs dev tools will trigger a request to /wp/v2/pages?search=home instead of just /wp/v2/pages.",
    "Let‚Äôs mirror this in our useSelect call as follows:",
    "The searchTerm is now used as a search query parameter when provided. Note that searchTerm is also specified inside the list of useSelect dependencies to make sure getEntityRecords is re-run when the searchTerm changes.",
    "Finally, here‚Äôs how MyFirstApp looks once we wire it all together:",
    "Voila! We can now filter the results:",
    "Let‚Äôs take a pause for a moment to consider the downsides of an alternative approach we could have taken ‚Äì working with the API directly. Imagine we sent the API requests directly:",
    "Working outside of core-data, we would need to solve two problems here.",
    "Firstly, out-of-order updates. Searching for ‚ÄûAbout‚Äù would trigger five API requests filtering for A, Ab, Abo, Abou, and About. These requests could finish in a different order than they started. It is possible that search=A would resolve after _ search=About_ and thus we‚Äôd display the wrong data.",
    "Gutenberg data helps by handling the asynchronous part behind the scenes. useSelect remembers the most recent call and returns only the data we expect.",
    "Secondly, every keystroke would trigger an API request. If you typed About, deleted it, and retyped it, it would issue 10 requests in total even though we could reuse the data.",
    "Gutenberg data helps by caching the responses to API requests triggered by getEntityRecords()  and reuses them on subsequent calls. This is especially important when other components rely on the same entity records.",
    "All in all, the utilities built into core-data are designed to solve the typical problems so that you can focus on your application instead.",
    "There is one problem with our search feature. We can‚Äôt be quite sure whether it‚Äôs still searching or showing no results:",
    "A few messages like  Loading‚Ä¶ or No results would clear it up. Let‚Äôs implement them! First,  PagesList has to be aware of the current status:",
    "Note that instead of building a custom loading indicator, we took advantage of the Spinner component.",
    "We still need to know whether the pages selector hasResolved or not. We can find out using the  hasFinishedResolution selector:",
    "wp.data.select('core').hasFinishedResolution( 'getEntityRecords', [ 'postType', 'page', { search: 'home' } ] )",
    "It takes the name of the selector and the exact same arguments you passed to that selector and returns either true if the data was already loaded or false if we‚Äôre still waiting. Let‚Äôs add it to useSelect:",
    "There is just one last problem. It is easy to make a typo and end up passing different arguments to getEntityRecords and hasFinishedResolution. It is critical that they are identical. We can remove this risk by storing the arguments in a variable:",
    "And voil√†! That‚Äôs it.",
    "All the pieces are in place, great! Here‚Äôs the complete JavaScript code of our app:",
    "All that‚Äôs left is to refresh the page and enjoy the brand new status indicator:",
    "We will build the application as a WordPress plugin, which means you need to have WordPress itself installed. One way to do this is by following the instructions on the Getting Started page. Once your setup is complete, you can follow along with the rest of this tutorial.",
    "Also, this tutorial will lean heavily on Redux concepts such as state, actions, and selectors. If you are not familiar with them, you may want to start by reviewing Getting Started With Redux.",
    "We‚Äôll do all the development inside of a WordPress plugin. Let‚Äôs start by creating a wp-content/plugins/my-first-gutenberg-app directory in your local WordPress environment. We will need to create four files inside that directory:",
    "Go ahead and create these files using the following snippets:",
    "src/index.js:",
    "style.css:",
    "my-first-gutenberg-app.php:",
    "package.json:",
    "This tutorial will proceed assuming the reader is familiar with ESNext syntax and the concept of build tools (like webpack). If that sounds confusing, you may want to review the Getting started with JavaScript Build Setup first.",
    "To install the build tool, navigate to the plugin directory using your terminal and run npm install.",
    "Once all the dependencies are in place, all that‚Äôs left is to run npm start and voila! A watcher will run in the terminal. You can then edit away in your text editor; after each save, it will automatically build.",
    "If you now go to the Plugins page, you should see a plugin called My first Gutenberg App. Go ahead and activate it. A new menu item labeled My first Gutenberg app should show up. Once you click it, you will see a page that says Hello from JavaScript!:",
    "Congratulations! You are now ready to start building the app!",
    "This tutorial aims to get you comfortable with the Gutenberg data layer. It guides you through building a simple React application that enables the user to manage their WordPress pages. The finished app will look like this:",
    "You may review the finished app in the gutenberg-examples repository.",
    "This tutorial will step through the fundamentals of creating a custom instance\nof a ‚Äúblock editor‚Äù using the @wordpress/block-editor package.",
    "The Gutenberg codebase is complex, with many packages and components, but at its core it is a tool for managing and editing blocks. Therefore, when working on the editor it is important to gain a better understanding of how block editing works at a fundamental level.",
    "To do this, this tutorial will walk you through building a fully functioning, custom block editor ‚Äúinstance‚Äù within WordPress, introducing you to the key packages and components along the way.",
    "By the end of this article, you should have gained a good understanding of how the block editor works and some of the knowledge required to put together your own block editor instances.",
    "We‚Äôre going to be creating an (almost) fully functioning Block Editor instance.",
    "This block editor will not be the same Block Editor you are familiar with when creating Posts in WP Admin. Rather it will be an entirely custom instance which will live within a custom WP Admin page called (imaginatively) ‚ÄúBlock Editor‚Äù.",
    "Our editor will have the following features:",
    "With that in mind, let‚Äôs start taking our first steps towards building this.",
    "Our custom editor is going to be built as a WordPress Plugin. To keep things simple. we‚Äôll call this Standalone Block Editor Demo because that is what it does. Nice!",
    "Let‚Äôs take a look at our Plugin file structure:",
    "Here‚Äôs a brief summary of what‚Äôs going on:",
    "The only item not shown above is the build/ directory, which is where our compiled JS and CSS files will be outputted by @wordpress/scripts ready to be enqueued by our Plugin.",
    "Note: throughout this tutorial, filename references will be placed in a comment at the top of each code snippet so you can follow along.",
    "With our basic file structure in place, we can now start looking at what package we‚Äôre going to need.",
    "Whilst the Gutenberg Editor is comprised of many moving parts, at it‚Äôs core is the @wordpress/block-editor package.",
    "It‚Äôs role is perhaps best summarized by its own README file:",
    "This is great and exactly what we need! Indeed, it is the main package we‚Äôll be using to create our custom block editor instance.",
    "However, before we can get to working with this package in code, we‚Äôre going to need to create a home for our editor within WP Admin.",
    "As a first step, we need to create a custom page within WP Admin.",
    "Note: if you‚Äôre already comfortable with the process of creating custom Admin pages in WordPress you might want to skip ahead.",
    "To do this we register our custom admin page using the standard WP add_menu_page() helper:",
    "Note the reference to a function getdave_sbe_render_block_editor which is the function which we will use to render the contents of the admin page.",
    "As the block editor is a React powered application, we now need to output some HTML into our custom page into which the JavaScript can render the block editor.",
    "To do this we need to look at our getdave_sbe_render_block_editor function referenced in the step above.",
    "Here we simply output some basic placeholder HTML.",
    "Note that we‚Äôve included an id attribute getdave-sbe-block-editor. Keep a note of that, as we‚Äôll be using it shortly.",
    "With our target HTML in place we can now enqueue some JavaScript (as well as some CSS styles) so that they will run on our custom Admin page.",
    "To do this we hook into admin_enqueue_scripts.",
    "First, we need to make sure we only run our custom code on our own admin page, so at the top of our callback function let‚Äôs exit early if the page doesn‚Äôt match our page‚Äôs identifier:",
    "With this in place, we can then safely register our main JavaScript file using the standard WP wp_enqueue_script function:",
    "To save time and space, the assignment of the $script_ variables has been omitted. You can review these here.",
    "Note that we register our script dependencies ($script_asset['dependencies']) as the 3rd argument ‚Äì these deps are being\ndynamically generated using @wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin which will\nensure that WordPress provided scripts are not included in the built\nbundle.",
    "We also need to register both our custom CSS styles and the WordPress default formatting library in order take advantage of some nice default styling:",
    "Looking at the @wordpress/block-editor package, we can see that it accepts a settings object to configure the default settings for the editor. These are available on the server side so we need to expose them for use within the JavaScript.",
    "To do this we inline the settings object as JSON assigned to the global window.getdaveSbeSettings object:",
    "With the PHP above in place to create our admin page, we‚Äôre now finally ready to use JavaScript to render a Block Editor into the page‚Äôs HTML.",
    "Let‚Äôs open up our main src/index.js file.",
    "Here we first pull in required JS packages and import our CSS styles (note using Sass requires extending the default @wordpress/scripts Webpack config).",
    "Next, once the DOM is ready we run a function which:",
    "Note: it is possible to render the editor from PHP without creating an unnecessary JS global. Check out the Edit Site package in Gutenberg Core for an example of this.",
    "Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the <Editor> component we saw being used above.",
    "Despite its name, this is not the actual core of the block editor. Rather it is a wrapper component we‚Äôve created to contain the components which form the main body of our custom editor.",
    "The first thing we do inside <Editor> is to pull in some dependencies.",
    "The most important of these are the internal components BlockEditor and Sidebar, which we will explore in greater detail shortly.",
    "The remaining components are largely static elements which form the layout and surrounding UI of the editor (eg: header and notice areas).",
    "With these components available we can proceed to define our <Editor> component.",
    "Here we are scaffolding the core of the editor‚Äôs layout alongside a few specialised context providers which make particular functionality available throughout the component hierarchy.",
    "Let‚Äôs examine these in more detail:",
    "With this basic component structure in place the only remaining thing left to do\nis wrap everything in the navigateRegions HOC to provide keyboard navigation between the different ‚Äúregions‚Äù in the layout.",
    "Now we have a our core layouts and components in place, it‚Äôs time to explore our\ncustom implementation of the block editor itself.",
    "The component for this is called <BlockEditor> and this is where the magic happens.",
    "Opening src/components/block-editor/index.js we see that this is the most\ncomplex of the components we have encountered thus far.",
    "There‚Äôs a lot going on so let‚Äôs break this down!",
    "To start, let‚Äôs focus on what is being rendered by the <BlockEditor> component:",
    "The key components to focus on here are <BlockEditorProvider> and <BlockList>. Let‚Äôs examine these.",
    "<BlockEditorProvider> is one of the most important components in the hierarchy. As we learnt earlier, it establishes a new block editing context for a new block editor.",
    "As a result, it is fundamental to the entire goal of our project.",
    "The children of <BlockEditorProvider> comprise the UI for the block\neditor. These components then have access to data (via Context) which enables\nthem to render and manage the Blocks and their behaviors within the editor.",
    "We can see that <BlockEditorProvider> accepts array of (parsed) block objects as its value prop and, when there‚Äôs a change detected within the editor, calls the onChange and/or onInput handler prop (passing the new Blocks as a argument).",
    "Internally it does this by subscribing to the provided registry (via the withRegistryProvider HOC), listening to block change events, determining whether Block changing was persistent, and then calling the appropriate onChange|Input handler accordingly.",
    "For the purposes of our simple project these features allow us to:",
    "It‚Äôs also worth recalling that the component accepts a settings prop. This accepts the editor settings which we inlined as JSON within init.php earlier. This configures features such as custom colors, available image sizes and much more.",
    "Alongside <BlockEditorProvider> the next most interesting component is <BlockList>.",
    "This is one of the most important components as it‚Äôs role is to render a list of Blocks into the editor.",
    "It does this in part thanks to being placed as a child of <BlockEditorProvider> which affords it full access to all information about the state of the current Blocks in the editor.",
    "Under the hood <BlockList> relies on several other lower-level components in order to render the list of Blocks.",
    "The hierarchy of these components can be approximated as follows:",
    "Here‚Äôs roughly how this works together to render our list of blocks:",
    "These are some of the most complex and involved components within the @wordpress/block-editor package. That said, if you want to have a strong grasp of how the editor works at a fundamental level, I strongly advise making a study of these components. I leave this as an exercise for the reader!",
    "Jumping back to our own custom <BlockEditor> component, it is also worth noting the following ‚Äúutility‚Äù components:",
    "These provide other important elements of functionality for our editor instance.",
    "Also within the render of our <BlockEditor>, is our <Sidebar> component.",
    "This is used ‚Äì alongside other things ‚Äì to display advanced Block settings via the <BlockInspector> component.",
    "However, the keen-eyed readers amongst you will have already noted the presence\nof a <Sidebar> component within our <Editor> (src/editor.js) component‚Äôs\nlayout:",
    "Opening src/components/sidebar/index.js we see that this is in fact the\ncomponent rendered within <Editor> above. However, the implementation utilises\nSlot/Fill to expose a Fill (<Sidebar.InspectorFill>) which we subsequently\nimport and render inside of our <BlockEditor> component (see above).",
    "With this in place, we then render <BlockInspector /> as a child of the\nSidebar.InspectorFill. This has the result of allowing us to keep\n<BlockInspector> within the React context of <BlockEditorProvider> whilst\nallowing it to be rendered into the DOM in a separate location (ie: in the <Sidebar>).",
    "This might seem overly complex, but it is required in order that\n<BlockInspector> can have access to information about the current Block.\nWithout Slot/Fill this setup would be extremely difficult to achieve.",
    "Aside:\n<BlockInspector>\nitself actually renders a Slot for <InspectorControls>. This is what allows you render a <InspectorControls> component inside\nthe edit() definition for your block and have\nit display within Gutenberg‚Äôs sidebar. I recommend looking into this component\nin more detail.",
    "And with that we have covered the render of our custom <BlockEditor>!",
    "We‚Äôve come a long way on our journey to create a custom block editor. But there is\none major area left to touch upon ‚Äì Block persistence; that is the act of having our\nBlocks saved and available between page refreshes.",
    "As this is only an experiment we‚Äôve opted to utilise the browser‚Äôs\nlocalStorage API to handle saving Block data. In a real-world scenario however\nyou‚Äôd like choose a more reliable and robust system (eg: a database).",
    "That said, let‚Äôs take a closer look at how we‚Äôre handling saving our Blocks.",
    "Opening src/components/block-editor/index.js we will notice we have created\nsome state to store our Blocks as an array:",
    "As mentioned earlier, blocks is passed to the ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù component <BlockEditorProvider> as its value prop. This ‚Äúhydrates‚Äù it with an initial set of Blocks. Similarly, the updateBlocks setter is hooked up to the onInput callback on <BlockEditorProvider> which ensures that our block state is kept in sync with changes made to blocks within the editor.",
    "If we now turn our attention to the onChange handler, we will notice it is\nhooked up to a function persistBlocks() which is defined as follows:",
    "This function accepts an array of ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù block changes and calls the state\nsetter updateBlocks. In addition to this however, it also stores the blocks\nwithin LocalStorage under the key getdavesbeBlocks. In order to achieve this\nthe Block data is serialized into Gutenberg ‚ÄúBlock Grammar‚Äù format, meaning it can be safely stored as a string.",
    "If we open DeveloperTools and inspect our LocalStorage we will see serialized\nBlock data stored and updated as changes occur within the editor. Below is an\nexample of the format:",
    "Having persistence in place is all well and good, but it‚Äôs useless unless that\ndata is retrieved and restored within the editor upon each full page reload.",
    "Accessing data is a side effect, so naturally we reach for our old (new!?)\nfriend the useEffect hook to handle this.",
    "In this handler, we:",
    "As a result of these operations the controlled <BlockEditorProvider> component\nis updated with the blocks restored from LocalStorage causing the editor to\nshow these blocks.",
    "Finally, for good measure we generate a notice ‚Äì which will display in our <Notice> component as a ‚Äúsnackbar‚Äù notice ‚Äì to indicate that the blocks have been restored.",
    "If you‚Äôve made it this far then congratulations! I hope you now have a better understanding of how the block editor works under the hood.",
    "In addition, you‚Äôve reviewed an working example of the code required to implement your own custom functioning block editor. This information should prove useful, especially as Gutenberg expands beyond editing just the Post and into Widgets, Full Site Editing and beyond!",
    "The full code for the custom functioning block editor we‚Äôve just built is available on GitHub. I encourage you to download and try it out for yourself. Experiment, then and take things even further!",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to step through the fundamentals of creating a custom instance of a ‚Äúblock editor‚Äù.",
    "The editor you will see in this tutorial (as above) is not the same Block Editor you are familiar with when creating Posts in with WordPress. Rather it is an entirely custom block editor instance built using the lower-level @wordpress/block-editor package (and friends).",
    "To follow along with this tutorial, you can download the accompanying WordPress plugin which includes all of the examples for you to try on your own site.",
    "Code snippets are provided using JSX syntax. Note it is not required to use JSX to create blocks or extend the editor, you can use plain JavaScript. However, once familiar with JSX, many developers tend find it is easier to read and write, thus most code examples you‚Äôll find use that syntax.",
    "The Gutenberg Project is not only building a better editor for WordPress, but also creating a platform to build upon. This platform consists of a set of JavaScript packages and tools that you can use in your web application. View the list of packages available on npm.",
    "The WordPress Components package contains a set of UI components you can use in your project. See the WordPress Storybook site for an interactive guide to the available components and settings.",
    "Here is a quick example, how to use components in your project.",
    "Install the dependency:",
    "Usage in React:",
    "Many components include CSS to add style, you will need to include for the components to appear correctly. The component stylesheet can be found in node_modules/@wordpress/components/build-style/style.css, you can link directly or copy and include it in your project.",
    "The @wordpress/scripts package is a collection of reusable scripts for JavaScript development ‚Äî includes scripts for building, linting, and testing ‚Äî all with no additional configuration files.",
    "Here is a quick example, on how to use wp-scripts tool in your project.",
    "You can then add a scripts section to your package.json file, for example:",
    "You can then use npm run build to build your project with all the default webpack settings already configured, likewise for formatting and linting. The start command is used for development mode. See the @wordpress/scripts package for full documentation.",
    "For more info, see the Getting Started with JavaScript tutorial in the Block Editor Handbook.",
    "The @wordpress/block-editor package allows you to create and use standalone block editors.",
    "You can learn more by reading the tutorial ‚ÄúBuilding a custom block editor‚Äù.",
    "The Query Loop block is a powerful tool that allows users to cycle through a determined list of posts and display a certain set of blocks that will inherit the context of each of the posts in the list. For example, it can be set to cycle through all the posts of a certain category and for each of those posts display their featured image. And much more, of course!",
    "But precisely because the Query Loop block is so powerful and allows for great customization, it can also be daunting. Most users wouldn‚Äôt want to be presented with the full capabilities of the Query Loop block, as most users wouldn‚Äôt be familiar with the concept of a ‚Äúquery‚Äù and its associated technical terms. Instead, most users will likely appreciate a pre-set version of the block, with fewer settings to adjust and clearer naming. The Post List variation offered by default is a good example of this practice: the user will be using the Query Loop block without being exposed to its technicalities, and will also be more likely to discover and understand the purpose of the block.",
    "In the same manner, a lot of extenders might need a way to present bespoke versions of the block, with their own presets, additional settings and without customization options which are irrelevant to their use-case (often, for example, their custom post type). The Query Loop block offers very powerful ways to create such variations.",
    "By registering your own block variation with some specific Query Loop block settings, you can have finer control over how it is presented, while still being able to use the full capabilities which the Query Loop block offers underneath. If you are not familiar with block variations, learn more about them here.",
    "With the block variations API you can provide the default settings that make the most sense for your use-case.",
    "Let‚Äôs go on a journey, for example, of setting up a variation for a plugin which registers a book custom post type.",
    "Your first step would be to create a variation which will be set up in such a way to provide a block variation which will display by default a list of books instead of blog posts. The full variation code will look something like this:",
    "If that sounds like a lot, don‚Äôt fret, let‚Äôs go through each of the properties here and see why they are there and what they are doing.",
    "Essentially, you would start with something like this:",
    "In this way, the users won‚Äôt have to choose the custom postType from the dropdown, and be already presented with the correct configuration. However, you might ask, how is a user going to find and insert this variation? Good question! To enable this, you should add:",
    "In this way, your block will show up just like any other block while the user is in the editor and searching for it. At this point you might also want to add a custom icon, title and description to your variation, just like so:",
    "At this point, your custom variation will be virtually indistinguishable from a stand-alone block. Completely branded to your plugin, easy to discover and directly available to the user as a drop in.",
    "Please note that the Query Loop block supports 'block' as a string in the scope property. In theory, that‚Äôs to allow the variation to be picked up after inserting the block itself. Read more about the Block Variation Picker here.",
    "However, it is unadvisable to use this currently, this is due to the Query Loop setup with patterns and scope: [ 'block' ] variations, all of the selected pattern‚Äôs attributes will be used except for postType and inherit query properties, which will likely lead to conflicts and non-functional variations.",
    "To circumvent this, there two routes, the first one is to add your default innerBlocks, like so:",
    "By having innerBlocks in your variation you essentially skip the setup phase of Query Loop block with suggested patterns and the block is inserted with these inner blocks as its starting content.",
    "The other way would be to register patterns specific to your variation, which are going to be suggested in the setup, and replace flows of the block.",
    "The Query Loop block determines if there is an active variation of itself and if there are specific patterns available for this variation. If there are, these patterns are going to be the only ones suggested to the user, without including the default ones for the original Query Loop block. Otherwise, if there are no such patterns, the default ones are going to be suggested.",
    "In order for a pattern to be ‚Äúconnected‚Äù with a Query Loop variation, you should add the name of your variation prefixed with the Query Loop name (e.g. core/query/$variation_name) to the pattern‚Äôs blockTypes property. For more details about registering patterns see here.",
    "If you have not provided innerBlocks in your variation, there is also a way to suggest ‚Äúconnected‚Äù variations when the user selects Start blank in the setup phase. This is handled in a similar fashion with ‚Äúconnected‚Äù patterns, by checking if there is an active variation of Query Loop and if there are any connected variations to suggest.",
    "In order for a variation to be connected to another Query Loop variation we need to define the scope attribute with ['block'] as value and the namespace attribute defined as an array. This array should contain the names(name property) of any variations they want to be connected to.",
    "For example, if we have a Query Loop variation exposed to the inserter(scope: ['inserter']) with the name products, we can connect a scoped block variation by setting its namespace attribute to ['products']. If the user selects this variation after having clicked Start blank, the namespace attribute will be overridden by the main inserter variation.",
    "There is one slight problem you might have realized after implementing this variation: while it is transparent to the user as they are inserting it, Gutenberg will still recognize the variation as a Query Loop block at its core and so, after its insertion, it will show up as a Query Loop block in the tree view of the editor, for instance.",
    "We need a way to tell the editor that this block is indeed your specific variation. This is what the isActive property is made for: it‚Äôs a way to determine whether a certain variation is active based on the block‚Äôs attributes. You could use it like this:",
    "You might be tempted to only compare the postType so that Gutenberg will recognize the block as your variation any time the postType matches book. This casts a net too wide, however, as other plugins might want to publish variations based on the book post type too, or we might just not want the variation to be recognized every time the user sets the type to book manually through the editor settings.",
    "That‚Äôs why the Query Loop block exposes a special attribute called namespace. It really doesn‚Äôt do anything inside the block implementation, and it‚Äôs used as an easy and consistent way for extenders to recognize and scope their own variation. In addition, isActive also accepts just an array of strings with the attributes to compare. Often, namespace would be sufficient, so you would use it like so:",
    "Like so, Gutenberg will know that it is your specific variation only in the case it matches your custom namespace! So convenient!",
    "Even with all of this, your custom post type might have unique requirements: it might support certain custom attributes that you might want to filter and query for, or some other query parameters might be irrelevant or even completely unsupported! We have build the Query Loop block with such use-cases in mind, so let‚Äôs see how you can solve this problem.",
    "Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt use at all the sticky attribute in your books, so that would be totally irrelevant to the customization of your block. In order to not confuse the users as to what a setting might do, and only exposing a clear UX to them, we want this control to be unavailable. Furthermore, let‚Äôs say that you don‚Äôt use the author field at all, which generally indicates the person who has added that post to the database, instead you use a custom bookAuthor field. As such, not only keeping the author filter would be confusing, it would outright ‚Äúbreak‚Äù your query.",
    "For this reason, the Query Loop block variations support a property called allowedControls, which accepts an array of keys of the controls we want to display on the inspector sidebar. By default, we accept all the controls, but as soon as we provide an array to this property, we want to specify only the controls which are going to be relevant for us!",
    "As of Gutenberg version 14.2, the following controls are available:",
    "In our case, the property would look like this:",
    "If you want to hide all the above available controls, you can set an empty array as a value of allowedControls.",
    "Notice that we have also disabled the postType control. When the user selects our variation, why show them a confusing dropdown to change the post type? On top of that it might break the block as we can implement custom controls, as we‚Äôll see shortly.",
    "Because our plugin uses custom attributes that we need to query, we want to add our own controls to allow the users to select those instead of the ones we have just disabled from the core inspector controls. We can do this via a React HOC hooked into a block filter, like so:",
    "Of course, you‚Äôll be responsible for implementing the logic of your control (you might want to take a look at @wordpress/components to make your controls fit seamlessly within the Gutenberg UI). Any extra parameter you assign within the query object inside the blocks attributes can be used to create a custom query according to your needs, with a little extra effort.",
    "Currently, you‚Äôll likely have to implement slightly different paths to make the query behave correctly both on the front-end side (i.e. on the end user‚Äôs side) and to show the correct preview on the editor side.",
    "The Query Loop block functions mainly through the Post Template block which receives the attributes and builds the query from there. Other first-class children of the Query Loop block (such as the Pagination block) behave in the same way. They build their query and then expose the result via the filter query_loop_block_query_vars.",
    "You can hook into that filter and modify your query accordingly. Just make sure you don‚Äôt cause side-effects to other Query Loop blocks by at least checking that you apply the filter only to your variation!",
    "(In the code above, we assume you have some way to access the block, for example within a pre_render_block filter, but the specific solution can be different depending on the use-case, so this is not a firm recommendation).",
    "To finish up our custom variation, we might want the editor to react to changes in our custom query and display an appropriate preview accordingly. This is not required for a functioning block, but it enables a fully integrated user experience for the consumers of your block.",
    "The Query Loop block fetches its posts to show the preview using the WordPress REST API. Any extra parameter added to the query object will be passed as a query argument to the API. This means that these extra parameters should be either supported by the REST API, or be handled by custom filters such as the rest_{$this->post_type}_query filter which allows you to hook into any API request for your custom post type. Like so:",
    "And, just like that, you‚Äôll have created a fully functional variation of the Query Loop block!",
    "Deprecated: It is no longer recommended to use WP-CLI or create-guten-block to generate block scaffolding.",
    "The official script to generate a block is the new @wordpress/create-block package. This package follows the new block directory guidelines, and creates the proper block, environment, and standards set by the project. See the new Create a Block tutorial for a complete walk-through.",
    "Dynamic blocks are blocks that build their structure and content on the fly when the block is rendered on the front end.",
    "Note : All the details about the creation of dynamic blocks are documented here. The below examples demonstrate the usage of block supports in dynamic blocks.",
    "A lot of blocks, including core blocks, offer similar customization options. Whether that is to change the background color, text color, or to add padding, margin customization options‚Ä¶",
    "Let‚Äôs examine the scenario to enable a user to change the background color and text color of a block.",
    "Because it is a dynamic block it doesn‚Äôt need to override the default save implementation on the client. Instead, it needs a server component. The contents in the front of your site depend on the function called by the render_callback property of register_block_type.",
    "Let‚Äôs see how we can achieve the same functionality, but by using block supports.",
    "And the server side part becomes:",
    "And that‚Äôs it, the addition of the ‚Äúsupports‚Äù key above, will automatically make the following changes to the block:",
    "To learn more about the block supports and see all the available properties that you can enable for your own blocks, please refer to the supports documentation.",
    "There are two primary uses for dynamic blocks:",
    "For many dynamic blocks, the save callback function should be returned as null, which tells the editor to save only the block attributes to the database. These attributes are then passed into the server-side rendering callback, so you can decide how to display the block on the front end of your site. When you return null, the editor will skip the block markup validation process, avoiding issues with frequently-changing markup.",
    "If you are using InnerBlocks in a dynamic block you will need to save the InnerBlocks in the save callback function using <InnerBlocks.Content/>",
    "You can also save an HTML representation of the block. If you provide a server-side rendering callback, this HTML will be replaced with the output of your callback, but will be rendered if your block is deactivated or your render callback is removed.",
    "Block attributes can be used for any content or setting you want to save for that block. In the first example above, with the latest posts block, the number of latest posts you want to show could be saved as an attribute. Or in the second example, attributes can be used for each piece of content you want to show in the front end ‚Äì such as heading text, paragraph text, an image, a URL, etc.",
    "The following code example shows how to create a dynamic block that shows only the last post as a link.",
    "There are a few things to notice:",
    "Note : For common customization settings including color, border, spacing customization and more, we will see on the next chapter how you can rely on block supports to provide such functionality in an efficient way.",
    "Gutenberg 2.8 added the <ServerSideRender> block which enables rendering to take place on the server using PHP rather than in JavaScript.",
    "Server-side render is meant as a fallback; client-side rendering in JavaScript is always preferred (client rendering is faster and allows better editor manipulation).",
    "Note that this code uses the wp-server-side-render package but not wp-data. Make sure to update the dependencies in the PHP code. You can use wp-scripts to automatically build dependencies (see the gutenberg-examples repo for PHP code setup).",
    "To avoid duplicating the same logic over and over in your blocks and to align the behavior of your block with core blocks, you can make use of the different supports properties.",
    "Let‚Äôs take the block we wrote in the previous chapter (example 3) and with just a single line of code, add support for text, link and background color customizations.",
    "Here‚Äôs the exact same code we used to register the block previously.",
    "Now, let‚Äôs alter the block.json file for that block, and add the supports key. (If you‚Äôre not using a block.json file, you can also add the key to the registerBlockType function call)",
    "To simplify block customization and ensure a consistent experience for users, there are a number of built-in UI patterns to help generate the editor preview. Like with the RichText component covered in the previous chapter, the wp.editor global includes a few other common components to render editing interfaces. In this chapter, we‚Äôll explore toolbars and the block inspector.",
    "When the user selects a block, a number of control buttons may be shown in a toolbar above the selected block. Some of these block-level controls are included automatically if the editor is able to transform the block to another type, or if the focused element is a RichText component.",
    "You can also customize the toolbar to include controls specific to your block type. If the return value of your block type‚Äôs edit function includes a BlockControls element, those controls will be shown in the selected block‚Äôs toolbar.",
    "Note that BlockControls is only visible when the block is currently selected and in visual editing mode. BlockControls are not shown when editing a block in HTML editing mode.",
    "The Settings Sidebar is used to display less-often-used settings or settings that require more screen space. The Settings Sidebar should be used for block-level settings only.",
    "If you have settings that affects only selected content inside a block (example: the ‚Äúbold‚Äù setting for selected text inside a paragraph): do not place it inside the Settings Sidebar. The Settings Sidebar is displayed even when editing a block in HTML mode, so it should only contain block-level settings.",
    "The Block Tab is shown in place of the Document Tab when a block is selected.",
    "Similar to rendering a toolbar, if you include an InspectorControls element in the return value of your block type‚Äôs edit function, those controls will be shown in the Settings Sidebar region.\nThe following example adds 2 color palettes to the sidebar, one for the text color and one for the background color.",
    "Block controls rendered in both the toolbar and sidebar will also be used when\nmultiple blocks of the same type are selected.",
    "Note : In the example above, we added text and background color customization support to our block to demonstrate the use of InspectorControls to add custom controls to the sidebar. That said, for common customization settings including color, border, spacing customization and more, we will see on the next chapter that you can rely on block supports to provide the same functionality in a more efficient way.",
    "The example blocks so far are still not very interesting because they lack options to customize the appearance of the message. In this section, we will implement a RichText field allowing the user to specify their own message. Before doing so, it‚Äôs important to understand how the state of a block (its ‚Äúattributes‚Äù) is maintained and changed over time.",
    "Until now, the edit and save functions have returned a simple representation of a paragraph element. We also learned how these functions are responsible for describing the structure of the block‚Äôs appearance. If the user changes a block, this structure may need to change. To achieve this, the state of a block is maintained throughout the editing session as a plain JavaScript object, and when an update occurs, the edit function is invoked again. Put another way: the output of a block is a function of its attributes.",
    "One challenge of maintaining the representation of a block as a JavaScript object is that we must be able to extract this object again from the saved content of a post. This is achieved with the block type‚Äôs attributes property:",
    "When registering a new block type, the attributes property describes the shape of the attributes object you‚Äôd like to receive in the edit and save functions. Each value is a source function to find the desired value from the markup of the block.",
    "In the code snippet above, when loading the editor, the content value will be extracted from the HTML of the paragraph element in the saved post‚Äôs markup.",
    "Earlier examples used the createElement function to create DOM nodes, but it‚Äôs also possible to encapsulate this behavior into ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù. This abstraction helps you share common behaviors and hide complexity in self-contained units.",
    "There are a number of components available to use in implementing your blocks. You can see one such component in the code below: the RichText component is part of the wp-block-editor package.",
    "The RichText component can be considered as a super-powered textarea element, enabling rich content editing including bold, italics, hyperlinks, etc.",
    "To use the RichText component, and using ES5 code, remember to add wp-block-editor to the dependency array of registered script handles when calling wp_register_script.",
    "Do not forget to also update the editor_script handle in register_block_type to gutenberg-examples-03-esnext.",
    "Implementing this behavior as a component enables you as the block implementer to be much more granular about editable fields. Your block may not need RichText at all, or it may need many independent RichText elements, each operating on a subset of the overall block state.",
    "Because RichText allows for nested nodes, you‚Äôll most often use it in conjunction with the html attribute source when extracting the value from saved content. You‚Äôll also use RichText.Content in the save function to output RichText values.",
    "Here is the complete block definition for Example 03.",
    "A block typically inserts markup (HTML) into post content that you want to style in some way. This guide walks through a few different ways you can use CSS with the block editor and how to work with styles and stylesheets.",
    "You will need a basic block and WordPress development environment to implement the examples shown in this guide. See the create a basic block or block tutorial to get setup.",
    "The following are different methods you can use to add style to your block, either in the editor or when saved.",
    "The first method shows adding the style inline. This transforms the defined style into a property on the element inserted.",
    "The useBlockProps React hook is used to set and apply properties on the block‚Äôs wrapper element. The following example shows how:",
    "The inline style works well for a small amount of CSS to apply. If you have much more than the above you will likely find that it is easier to manage with them in a separate stylesheet file.",
    "The useBlockProps hooks includes the classname for the block automatically, it generates a name for each block using the block‚Äôs name prefixed with wp-block-, replacing the / namespace separator with a single -.",
    "For example the block name: gutenberg-examples/example-02-stylesheets would get the classname: wp-block-gutenberg-examples-example-02-stylesheets. It might be a bit long but best to avoid conflicts with other blocks.",

The following code defines a message attribute; the attribute type is a string; the source is the text from the selector which is a div tag.",
    "Add this to the src/block.json file. The attributes are at the same level as the name and title fields.",
    "When the block loads it will look at the saved content for the block, look for the div tag, take the text portion, and store the content in an attributes.message variable.",
    "Note: The text portion is equivalent to innerText attribute of a DOM element. For more details and other examples see the Block Attributes documentation.",
    "The attributes are passed to both the edit and save functions. The setAttributes function is also passed, but only to the edit function. The setAttributes function is used to set the values. Additional parameters are also passed in to the edit and save functions, see the edit/save documentation for more details.",
    "The attributes is a JavaScript object containing the values of each attribute, or default values if defined. The setAttributes is a function to update an attribute.",
    "For our example block, the component we are going to use is the TextControl component, it is similar to an HTML text input field. You can see documentation for TextControl component. You can browse an interactive set of components in this Storybook.",
    "The component is added similar to an HTML tag, setting a label, the value is set to the attributes.message and the onChange function uses the setAttributes to update the message attribute value.",
    "The save function will simply write the attributes.message as a div tag since that is how we defined it to be parsed.",
    "OPTIONAL: For IDE support (code completion and hints), you can install the @wordpress/components module which is where the TextControl component is imported from. This install command is optional since the build process automatically detects @wordpress/* imports and specifies as dependencies in the assets file.",
    "Update the edit.js and save.js files to the following, replacing the existing functions.",
    "edit.js file:",
    "save.js file:",
    "If you have previously run npm run start, and the script is still running, you can reload the editor now and add the block to test.\nOtherwise rebuild the block using npm run build, reload the editor and add the block. Type a message in the editor, save, and view it in the post.",
    "Next Section: Code Implementation",
    "At its simplest, a block in the WordPress block editor is a JSON object with a specific set of properties.",
    "The javascript part is done in the src/index.js file.",
    "The first parameter in the registerBlockType function is the block name, this should match exactly to the name property in the block.json file. By importing the metadata from block.json and referencing the name property in the first parameter we ensure that they will match, and continue to match even if the name is subsequently changed in block.json.",
    "The second parameter to the function is the block object. See the block registration documentation for full details.",
    "The last two block object properties are edit and save, these are the key parts of a block. Both properties are functions that are included via the import above.",
    "The results of the edit function is what the editor will render to the editor page when the block is inserted.",
    "The results of the save function is what the editor will insert into the post_content field when the post is saved. The post_content field is the field in the wp_posts table in the WordPress database that is used to store the content of the post.",
    "Most of the properties are set in the src/block.json file.",
    "The title is the title of the block shown in the Inserter and in other areas of the editor.",
    "The icon is the icon shown in the Inserter. The icon property expects any Dashicon name as a string, see list of available icons. You can also provide an SVG object, but for now it‚Äôs easiest to just pick a Dashicon name.",
    "The category specified is a string and must be one of: ‚Äúcommon, formatting, layout, widgets, or embed‚Äù. You can create your own custom category name, see documentation for details.",
    "If you look at the generated src/save.js file, the block title and description are wrapped in a function that looks like this:",
    "This is an internationalization wrapper that allows for the string ‚ÄúGutenpride‚Äù to be translated. The second parameter, ‚Äúgutenpride‚Äù is called the text domain and gives context for where the string is from. The JavaScript internationalization, often abbreviated i18n, matches the core WordPress internationalization process. See the Internationalization in Plugin Developer Handbook for more details.",
    "Next Section: Block Attributes",
    "A block is added to the block editor using a WordPress plugin. You can create your own plugin, and after installing and activating the plugin use the block. Let‚Äôs first look at what makes up a WordPress plugin.",
    "A WordPress plugin is a set of files within the site‚Äôs wp-content/plugins directory. For our tutorial, we will use the @wordpress/create-block package to generate the necessary plugin files.",
    "(1A) If you do not plan to use wp-env, change to your local WordPress plugin directory. For example in Local it is: ~\\Local Sites\\mywp\\app\\public\\wp-content\\plugins",
    "-or-",
    "(1B) If using wp-env start, you can work from any directory for your project; wp-env will map it as a plugin directory for your site.",
    "(2) Once in the right directory for your environment, the next step is to run the following command to generate plugin files:",
    "A new directory gutenpride is created with all the necessary plugin files. This tutorial will walk through and explain the plugin files, please explore and become familiar with them also.",
    "The main plugin file created is the PHP file gutenpride.php, at the top of this file is the Plugin Header comment block that defines the plugin.",
    "Let‚Äôs confirm the plugin is loaded and working.",
    "(3A) If you are using Local, or other environment confirm your WordPress site is started.",
    "(3B) If you are using wp-env, see Development Environment setup, then you should now run from inside the gutenpride directory:",
    "This will start your local WordPress site and use the current directory as your plugin directory. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/ and login, the default username is ‚Äúadmin‚Äù and password is ‚Äúpassword‚Äù, no quotes.",
    "The generated plugin should now be listed on the Plugins admin page in your WordPress install. Switch WordPress to the plugins page and activate.",
    "For more on creating a WordPress plugin see Plugin Basics, and Plugin Header requirements for explanation and additional fields you can include in your plugin header.",
    "The package.json file defines the JavaScript properties for your project. This is a standard file used by NPM for defining properties and scripts it can run, the file and process is not specific to WordPress.",
    "A package.json file was created with the create script, this defines the dependencies and scripts needed. You can install dependencies. The only initial dependency is the @wordpress/scripts package that bundles the tools and configurations needed to build blocks.",
    "In package.json, there is a scripts property that defines what command to run when using npm run (cmd). In our generated package.json file, the two main scripts point to the commands in the wp-scripts package:",
    "These scripts are run by using: npm run build or npm run start.",
    "Use npm run build for running once to create a ‚Äúproduction‚Äù build. This compresses the code down so it downloads faster, but makes it harder to read using browser tools‚Äîgood for final deployment but not while developing.",
    "Use npm run start for creating a ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù build, this does not compress the code so it is easier to read using browser tools, plus source maps that make debugging easier. Additionally, development build will start a watch process that waits and watches for changes to the file and will rebuild each time it is saved; so you don‚Äôt have to run the command for each change.",
    "By default, the build scripts looks for src/index.js for the JavaScript file to build and will save the built file to build/index.js. In the upcoming sections, we will look closer at that script, but first let‚Äôs make sure it is loaded in WordPress.",
    "To load the built script, so it is run within the editor, you need to tell WordPress about the script. This is done in the init action in the gutenpride.php file.",
    "The register_block_type function registers the block we are going to create and specifies the editor script handle registered from the metadata provided in build/block.json file with the editorScript field. So now when the editor loads it will load this script. The source metadata file src/block.json is copied during the build process:",
    "For the editorScript provided in the block metadata, the build process creates a secondary asset file that contains the list of dependencies and a file version based on the timestamp, this is the build/index.asset.php file.",
    "The wp_register_script function used internally registers a name, called the handle, and relates that name to the script file. The dependencies are used to specify if the script requires including other libraries. The version is specified so the browser will reload if the file changed.",
    "The wp_set_script_translations function tells WordPress to load translations for this script, if they exist. See more about translations & internationalization.",
    "With the above in place, create a new post to load the editor and check your plugin is in the inserter. You can use / to search, or click the box with the [+] and search for ‚ÄúGutenpride‚Äù to find the block.",
    "It is a good skill to learn and get comfortable using the web console. This is where JavaScript errors are shown and a nice way to test out snippets of JavaScript. See Firefox Developer Tools documentation.",
    "To open the developer tools in Firefox, use the menu selecting Web Developer : Toggle Tools, on Chrome, select More Tools -> Developers Tools. For both browsers, the keyboard shortcut on Windows is Ctrl+Shift+I, or on Mac Cmd+Shift+I. On Windows & Linux, the F12 key also works. You can then click Console to view logs.",
    "Try running npm run start that will start the watch process for automatic rebuilds. If you then make an update to src/index.js file, you will see the build run, and if you reload the WordPress editor you‚Äôll see the change.",
    "For more info, see the build section of the Getting Started with JavaScript tutorial in the Block Editor Handbook.",
    "Hopefully, at this point, you have your plugin created and activated. We have the package.json with the @wordpress/scripts dependency, that defines the build and start scripts. The basic block is in place and can be added to the editor.",

    "This article covers setting up the local WordPress development environment using Docker on Ubuntu.",
    "For Ubuntu 20.04.1, the standard docker binaries in the repository work as needed:",
    "For earlier versions of Ubuntu, the docker binaries included in repositories did not support the features needed for the WordPress environment.",
    "If you run into this error, when running npm run wp-env from the Gutenberg directory:",
    "First, make sure docker is running. You can check using ps -ef | grep docker which should show something like:",
    "If docker is not running, try to start the service using:",
    "If docker is running, then it is not listening how the WordPress environment is trying to communicate. Try adding the following service override file to include listening on tcp. See docker documentation, How do I enable the remote API for dockerd",
    "Restart the service from the command-line",
    "After restarting the services, set the environment variable DOCKER_HOST and try starting using:",
    "Your environment should be setup at: http://localhost:8888/",
    "This guide is for setting up your local environment for JavaScript development for creating plugins and tools to extend WordPress and the block editor. If you are looking to contribute to Gutenberg project itself, see additional documentation in the Getting Started guide.",
    "A development environment is a catch-all term for what you need setup on your computer to work. The three main pieces needed for our development environment are:",
    "Here is a summary of the guide. See each section for additional details and explanations.",
    "1. Install Node development tools",
    "Download and install Node Version Manager (nvm)",
    "Quit and restart terminal\nInstall Node.js v14.",
    "2. WordPress Development Site",
    "First download, install, and start Docker Desktop following the instructions for your OS.",
    "Start the environment from an existing plugin or theme directory, or a new working directory:",
    "You will have a full WordPress site installed, navigate to: http://localhost:8888/ using your browser, log in to the WordPress dashboard at http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/ using Username ‚Äúadmin‚Äù and Password ‚Äúpassword‚Äù, without the quotes.",
    "3. Code Editor",
    "You can use any text editor to write code. For example, Visual Studio Code is a popular open-source editor. You can follow instructions on their site to install it for your OS.",
    "The tools needed for development are Node and NPM. Nodejs is a runtime environment that allows running JavaScript outside of the browser. NPM is the Node Package Manager, it is used for installing dependencies and running scripts. The script npx is also installed with Nodejs‚Äîthis script is used to run packages not yet installed‚Äîwe will use npx to bootstrap a block.",
    "The tools are used to convert the JavaScript we are going to write into a format that browsers can run. This is called transpiling or the build step.",
    "For Mac and Linux, it is recommended to use the Node Version Manager (nvm). Using nvm to install node allows installing specific versions, plus installs locally in your home directory and avoids any global permission issues.",
    "For Windows, or alternative installs, you can download a Nodejs installer directly from the main Node.js website, v14 is recommended. Installers are available for Windows and Mac, and binaries available for Linux. See Node.js site for additional installation methods.",
    "Here are the quick instructions to install using nvm, see the full installation instructions for additional details.",
    "Run the following on the command-line to install nvm:",
    "Note: On macOS, the required developer tools are not installed by default, if not already installed you may be prompted to download the install.",
    "After installing nvm, you need to use it to install Node.js, to install v14, run:",
    "If there is an error running the above command, for example a common error that occurs is:",
    "First, try quitting and restarting your terminal to pick up the installed config.",
    "If restarting did not resolve the problem, you might need to create the default profile file.",
    "On macOS Catalina, the default shell is zsh, to create the profile file type touch ~/.zshrc on the command-line. It is fine to run if the file already exists. Note, ~/ is a shortcut to your home directory. For Ubuntu, including WSL, the default profile is bash, use touch ~/.bashrc to create.",
    "After creating the profile file, re-run the install command:",
    "The important part after installing is being able to use them in your terminal. Open a terminal command-line and type node -v and npm -v to confirm they are installed.",
    "Your versions may not match exactly, that is fine. The minimum version for Node.js is >= 12 and for npm >= 6.9, using v14 will be supported until upgrade is required.",
    "There are several ways to run WordPress locally on your own computer, or you could even develop on a cloud hosted computer, though this may be slower.",
    "The WordPress wp-env package lets you set up a local WordPress environment for building and testing plugins and themes, without any additional configuration.",
    "The wp-env tool uses Docker to create a virtual machine that runs the WordPress site. There are instructions available for installing Docker on Windows 10 Pro, other versions of Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. If using Ubuntu, see our additional notes for help installing Docker on Ubuntu.",
    "After you have installed Docker, go ahead and install the wp-env tool. This command will install the tool globally, which means you can run it from any directory:",
    "To confirm it is installed and available, run:",
    "The wp-env script is used to create a Docker WordPress environment. You can use this script to start an environment with your plugin activated by running it from the directory containing your plugin. For example if you are following the create block tutorial, this would be in the generated directory like so:",
    "You can access your environment in your browser at: http://localhost:8888/, the default username is admin and default password is password. For more information controlling the Docker environment see the @wordpress/env package readme.",
    "When using the script while developing a single plugin, wp-env start can mount and activate the plugin automatically when run from the directory containing the plugin. Note: This also works for themes when run from the directory in which you are developing the theme.",
    "If you run wp-env start from a directory that is not a plugin or theme, a generic WordPress environment will be created. The script will display the following warning, it is fine if this is your intention.",
    "You can use the .wp-env.json configuration file to create an environment that works with multiple plugins and/or themes. See the @wordpress/env package for additional details.",
    "A common issue when running wp-env is Error while running docker-compose command.",
    "If you see the error: Host is already in use by another container",
    "Docker is just one method to run a local WordPress environment. Block development and extending WordPress is done using normal plugins, so any WordPress environment can be used. Here are some alternatives that you can consider which do not require installing Docker.",
    "WampServer or MAMP environments, both are quite similar to Local, combining a web server, PHP, and database. However these tools are not WordPress specific, so if you are not already using them, Local might be an easier option.",
    "Remote server ‚Äì you can work on a remote server, most hosts provide a quick WordPress setup. However, this will require additional time thorughout development syncing to the server, or working directly on the remote server.",
    "The important part is having a WordPress site installed, and know where and how to update files in the plugins directory.",
    "Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor for JavaScript development. It works quite well across the three major platforms (Windows, Linux, and Mac), it is open-source and actively maintained by Microsoft. Plus Visual Studio Code has a vibrant community providing plugins and extensions; it is becoming the defacto standard for web development.",
    "Alternative editors include Sublime Text that is also available across platforms, though is a commercial product; or other free alternatives include Vim, Atom, and Notepad++ all support standard JavaScript style development.",
    "You can use any editor you‚Äôre comfortable with, it is more a personal preference. The development setup for WordPress block editor is a common JavaScript environment and most editors have plugins and support. The key is having a way to open, edit, and save text files.",
    "Here are a few instructions if you need to start over, or want to remove what was installed.",
    "To uninstall Node/NVM, delete the NVM directory, this is typically installed at $HOME/.nvm, delete using",
    "If this does not work and the $NVM_DIR environment variable is set you can remove using rm -rf \"$NVM_DIR\"",
    "To clean up any installed JavaScript packages remove the global .npm directory at $HOME/.npm,",
    "Just as you confirmed the installation worked, you can confirm the uninstall worked. First quit and restart terminal and then try to run npm -v, node -v, and nvm -v you should then see a ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù error in the terminal."
