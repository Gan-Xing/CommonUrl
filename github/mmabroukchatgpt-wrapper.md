See below for details on using ChatGPT as an API from Python.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need `setuptools` installed. You can install it using `pip install setuptools`. Make sure that you have the last version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

To use the 'chatgpt-api' backend (the default), you need a database backend (SQLite by default, any configurable in SQLAlchemy allowed).

## Installation

### Code

#### From packages

Install the latest version of this software directly from github with pip:
    
    
    pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper

#### From source (recommended for development)

  * Install the latest version of this software directly from git: 
    
        git clone https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper.git

  * Install the the development package: 
    
        cd chatgpt-wrapper
    pip install -e .




### Backend

The wrapper works with several differnt backends to connect to the ChatGPT models, and installation is different for each backend.

#### API (REST-based): **DEFAULT**

  * Pros: 
    * Fast (many operations run locally for speed)
    * Simple API authentication
    * Full model customizations
    * You control your data
  * Cons: 
    * Only paid version available (as of this writing)
    * More complex setup suitable for technical users



Grab an API key from <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>

Export the key into your local environment:
    
    
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<API_KEY>

Windows users, see [here](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) for how to edit environment variables.

To tweak the configuration for the current profile, see Configuration

##### Database configuration

The API backend requires a database server to store conversation data. The wrapper leverages [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for this.

The simplest supported database is SQLite (which is already installed on most modern operating systems), but you can use any database that is supported by SQLAlchemy.

Check the `database` setting from the `config` command above, which will show you the currently configured connection string for a default SQLite database.

If you're happy with that setting, nothing else needs to be done -- the database will be created automatically in that location when you run the program.

##### Initial user creation and login

Once the database is configured, run the program with no arguments:
    
    
    chatgpt

It will recognize no users have been created, and prompt you to create the first user:

  * Username: Required, no spaces or special characters
  * Email: Optional
  * Password: Optional, if not provided the user can log in without a password



Once the user is created, execute the `/login` command with the username:
    
    
    /login [username]

Once you're logged in, you have full access to all commands.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The user authorization system from the command line is 'admin party' -- meaning every logged in user has admin privileges, including editing and deleting other users.

##### Setting the default model

The default model used when communicating with the LLM service is configured per user.

To change the default model for a user:

  * Log in as the user
  * Run `/user-edit`
  * Step through the settings, including the one to set the default model



#### Playwright (browser-based): **DEPRECATED**

This backend is deprecated, and may be removed in a future release.

Support will not be provided for using the `ChatGPT` class of this backend directly.

  * Pros: 
    * Free or paid version available (as of this writing)
    * Fairly easy to set up for non-technical users
  * Cons: 
    * Slow (runs a full browser session)
    * Clunky authentication method
    * No model customizations
    * Third party controls your data



In your profile configuration file, you'll want to make sure the backend is set to the following in order to use the browser backend:
    
    
    backend: 'chatgpt-browser'

To tweak the configuration for the current profile, see Configuration

Install a browser in playwright (if you haven't already). The program will use firefox by default.
    
    
    playwright install firefox
    

Start up the program in `install` mode:
    
    
    chatgpt install

This opens up a browser window. Log in to ChatGPT in the browser window, walk through all the intro screens, then exit program.
    
    
    1> /exit

Restart the program without the `install` parameter to begin using it.
    
    
    chatgpt

### Notes for Windows users

Most other operating systems come with SQLite (the default database choice) installed, Windows may not.

If not, you can grab the 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file from <https://www.sqlite.org/download.html>, then place the DLL in `C:\Windows\System32` directory.

You also may need to install Python, if so grab the latest stable package from <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/> \-- make sure to select the install option to `Add Python to PATH`.

For the `/editor` command to work, you'll need a command line editor installed and in your path. You can control which editor is used by setting the `EDITOR` environment variable to the name of the editor executable, e.g. `nano` or `vim`.

## Configuration

Run the program with the 'config' command:
    
    
    chatgpt config

This will show all the current configuration settings, the most important ones for installation are:

  * **Config dir:** Where configuration files are stored
  * **Current profile:** (shown in the 'Profile configuration' section)
  * **Config file:** The configuration file current being used
  * **Data dir:** The data storage directory



From a running `chatgpt` instance, execute `/config` to view the current configuration.

Configuration is optional, default values will be used if no configuration profile is provided. The default configuation settings can be seen in [config.sample.yaml](/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper/blob/main/config.sample.yaml) \-- the file is commented with descriptions of the settings -- DON'T just copy this file as your configuration! Instead, use it as a reference to tweak the configuration to your liking.

_NOTE:_ Not all settings are available on all backends. See the example config for more information.

Command line arguments overrride custom configuration settings, which override default configuration settings.

### Editing the configuration for the current profile

  1. Start the program: `chatgpt`
  2. Open the profile's configuration file in an editor: `/config edit`
  3. Edit file to taste and save
  4. Restart the program



## Templates (alpha, subject to change)

The wrapper comes with a full template management system.

Templates allow storing text in template files, and quickly leveraging the contents as your user input.

Features:

  * Per-profile templates
  * Create/edit templates
  * `{{ variable }}` syntax substitution
  * Five different workflows for collecting variable values, editing, and running



See the various `/help template` commands for more information.

### Builtin variables

The wrapper exposes some builtin variables that can be used in templates:

  * `{{ clipboard }}` \- Insert the contents of the clipboard



### Front matter

Templates may include front matter (see [examples](/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper/blob/main/examples/templates)).

These front matter attributes have special functionality:

  * title: Sets the title of new conversations to this value
  * description: Displayed in the output of `/templates`
  * model_customizations: A hash of model customizations to apply when the template is run (see `/config` for available model customizations)



All other attributes will be passed to the template as variable substitutions.

## Plugins (alpha, subject to change)

### Using plugins

  1. Place the plugin file in either:


  * The main `plugins` directory of this module
  * A `plugins` directory in your profile


  2. Enable the plugin in your configuration:
    
        plugins:
      enabled:
        # This is a list of plugins to enable, each list item should be the name of a plugin file, without the extension.
        - test

Note that setting `plugins.enabled` will overwrite the default enabled plugins. see `/config` for a list of default enabled plugins.




### Core plugins:

  * **test:** Test plugin, echos back the command you give it
  * **awesome:** Use a prompt from Awesome ChatGPT Prompts: <https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts>
  * **database:** Send natural language commands to a database **WARNING: POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS -- DATA INTEGRITY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED.**
  * **data_query:** Send natural language commands to a loaded file of structured data
  * **shell:** Transform natural language into a shell command, and optionally execute it **WARNING: POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS -- YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VALIDATING THE COMMAND RETURNED BY THE LLM, AND THE OUTCOME OF ITS EXECUTION.**
  * **zap:** Send natural language commands to Zapier actions: <https://nla.zapier.com/get-started/>



### Writing plugins

There is currently no developer documentation for writing plugins.

The `plugins` directory has some default plugins, examining those will give a good idea for how to design a new one.

Currently, plugins for the shell can only add new commands. An instantiated plugin has access to these resources:

  * `self.config`: The current instantiated Config object
  * `self.log`: The instantiated Logger object
  * `self.backend`: The instantiated backend
  * `self.shell`: The instantiated shell

## Usage

### Shell

#### Command line arguments

Run `chatgpt --help`

#### One-shot mode

To run the CLI in one-shot mode, simply follow the command with the prompt you want to send to ChatGPT:
    
    
    chatgpt Hello World!
    

#### Interactive mode

To run the CLI in interactive mode, execute it with no additional arguments:
    
    
    chatgpt
    

Once the interactive shell is running, you can see a list of all commands with:
    
    
    /help
    

...or get help for a specific command with:
    
    
    /help <command>
    

### Python

**IMPORTANT:** Use of browser backend's `ChatGPT` class has been deprectated, no support will be provided for this usage.

You can use the API backend's `OpenAIAPI` class to interact directly with the chat LLM.

Create an instance of the class and use the `ask` method to send a message to OpenAI and receive the response. For example:
    
    
    from chatgpt_wrapper import OpenAIAPI
    
    bot = OpenAIAPI()
    success, response, message = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
    if success:
        print(response)
    else:
        raise RuntimeError(message)

The ask method takes a string argument representing the message to send to the API, and returns a string representing the response received.

You may also stream the response as it comes in from the API in chunks using the `ask_stream` generator.

To pass custom configuration to ChatGPT, use the Config class:
    
    
    from chatgpt_wrapper import OpenAIAPI
    from chatgpt_wrapper.core.config import Config
    
    config = Config()
    config.set('browser.debug', True)
    bot = OpenAIAPI(config)
    success, response, message = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
    if success:
        print(response)
    else:
        raise RuntimeError(message)

### Flask API (experimental)

  * Run `python chatgpt_wrapper/gpt_api.py --port 5000` (default port is 5000) to start the server
  * Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
  * Test whether it is working using `pytest tests/integration/api_test.py`
  * See an example of interaction with api in `tests/integration/example_api_call.py`



## Docker (experimental)

Build a docker image for testing `chatgpt-wrapper`:

Make sure your OpenAI key has been exported into your host environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Run the following commands:
    
    
    docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
    docker exec -it chatgpt-wrapper-container /bin/bash -c "chatgpt"

Follow the instructions to create the first user.

Enjoy the chat!

## Test suite

The project uses [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org).
    
    
    pip install pytest
    

To run all tests:
    
    
    pytest
    

## Troubleshooting

### OpenAI system issues

**Oftentimes issues are related to upstream service problems with OpenAI, so please check<https://status.openai.com> before concluding there's an issue with this codebase!**

### Playwright (browser-based) backend issues

It's possible that:

  1. Your session has gone stale: Try issuing a `/session` command to refresh it
  2. Your browser session information is corrupted: Try `chatgpt reinstall` and go through the login process again
  3. You're running an outdated version of this project, or one of its dependencies: Completely reinstall the project and its dependencies
  4. You're running into geolocation restrictions in OpenAI's security systems: Try proxying your requests through a VPN server in the US.



## Upgrading:

### Via pip

Until an official release exists, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall:
    
    
    pip uninstall -y chatGPT
    pip install chatGPT

### Via git

If the package was installed via `pip install -e`, simply pull in the latest changes from the repository:
    
    
    git pull

## GPT4

### API backend

To use GPT-4 with this backend, you must have been granted access to the model in your OpenAI account.

NOTE: If you have not been granted access, you'll probably see an error like this:
    
    
    InvalidRequestError(message='The model: `gpt-4` does not exist', param=None, code='model_not_found', http_status=404, request_id=None)
    

There is nothing this project can do to fix the error for you -- contact OpenAI and request GPT-4 access.

Follow one of the methods below to utilize GPT-4 in this backend:

##### Method 1: Set the default user model

See Setting the default model above.

##### Method 2: Dynamically switch

From within the shell, execute this command:
    
    
    /model gpt4
    

### Playwright (browser-based) backend: **DEPRECATED**

To use GPT-4 with this backend, you must have a ChatGPT-Plus subscription.

Follow one of the methods below to utilize GPT-4 in this backend:

##### Method 1: Command line argument

Enter the following command in your shell:
    
    
    chatgpt --model=gpt4
    

##### Method 2: Modify the `config.yaml` file

Update your `config.yaml` file to include the following line:
    
    
    chat:
      model: gpt4
    

Then start the program normally:
    
    
    chatgpt
    

##### Method 3: Dynamically switch

From within the shell, execute this command:
    
    
    /model gpt4
    

### Python module

To use GPT-4 within your Python code, follow the template below:
    
    
    from chatgpt_wrapper import OpenAIAPI
    from chatgpt_wrapper.core.config import Config
    
    config = Config()
    config.set('chat.model', 'gpt4')
    bot = OpenAIAPI(config)
    success, response, message = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
